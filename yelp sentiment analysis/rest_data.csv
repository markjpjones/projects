the coupon offered salmon but for an $8 upgrade you can get the flanks of nasty meat.  the food was subpar to say the least and my wine glass came with spots.  i was sickened.  then the lady comes around to offer a free pic, nice with but the exception comes when you try to offer an 8x11 at a cost of $22.

7LzBpgVCatng-9qQSaOkIg,2009,"yummers! we got discounted vouchers at the tickets 4 less counters on the strip. paid $3 to get the discounted price of $24.95 instead of the regular price of $41. the guy at the ticket counter said they sell the most vouchers for pampas than all their shows combined. good deal. the dinner was all you can eat of 10 meats. i have to say, my favorite was the roasted herb chicken. some of the meat was a bit dry and tough to chew through, but i was pretty satisfied with the different flavors. there are some other brazilian bbq places where the meats just all start tasting the same. another favorite was the bacon wrapped turkey. the turkey was really moist, but i think that's because it was processed. they came out in cubes on those long sticks. if i remember correctly, there were two types of filet mignon. i remember liking the one that wasn't with parmesan .
the service here was excellent. we brought our own wine. when we called, they said the corkage fee was $15, but it turned out to be $10. our waiter and also a manager kept checking in on us and taking away our plates. additionally, there was a separate buffet with lots of salad choices. i liked the pineapple salad, kale, and the fried bananas. yummers again!",4,1,0.24699096876237314

IOqLURvZ6okZEagkwhSECw,2017,"okay, for those reading my review. hello. buy a travelzoo voucher before dining. trust me, our original bill was over $270 but with a travelzoo voucher, there was a discount of $209 dollars. total paid: $73.30, tip not included. 

check in with yelp for a caiparinha/alcoholic drink. our server, mindy was phenomenal. she recommended white sangria (part of the voucher deal) and we readily agreed. all four of us got an alcoholic drink but when we took the first sip, our eyes bulged. maybe we're just lightweights (probably) but the drinks were way too strong. mindy came by later and noticed the drinks were still full, she asked what was wrong. we explained and she collected our drinks and promised they would be remade. true to her words, she came back with the new drinks and yup, us weak asians could finally drink our caiparinhas now. 

food: 

there is an unlimited sides buffet. it was filled with cheeses, beans, salads and beets, cheese rolls and a variety of pasta. also pulled pork (a must!) and mashed potatoes. 

with brazilian steakhouses, you sit and wait for servers carrying meat chunks to come to your table and carve you a slice. you'll use your tongs to grab the pieces. there is a little circular paper on your table. when you want meat to continue coming to your table, keep it on the green side. when you are done, flip it to the red side. keep it where the servers can see it. meats that came to our table were picanha, sirloin, lamb, pork shoulder, bacon-wrapped chicken, and sausages. pineapples were also making the rounds. meats are salty and for the most part, tough and dry. i ended up being more satisfied with the pulled pork from the sides buffet. 

overall, i would not pay full price for this. my main gripe was that we asked for a water refill 3 times and didn't get it until we were done with our meat selection. by then, we were really thirsty and feeling dizzy from sodium overload. but otherwise, good experience. the stars are for the side buffet, the meat servers and for mindy. 

notes: 
-buy a voucher!
-make a reservation, we left at 8:30 and there were crowds of people waiting 
-water is $1 per person 
-ask to be seated in mindy's section!",4,1,0.43690064736839884

ORclX3oGdQBkwZprLhIEAA,2017,"my family and i were severely disappointed with this steakhouse. we came in around 1pm, the middle of lunch service, with a restaurant.com coupon. the hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly and addressed by the waitress as to the salad bar and how a brazilian steakhouse works. 

the salad bar has the brazilian essentials: traditional cheese bread, soggy from the steamer, a rotating pasta surprise that tastes from a can or bottle, cheap deli cold cuts in place of the brazilian meats and your standard salad fixings and dressings.

if you were expecting to enjoy meat at this steakhouse, prepare to be severely disappointed as the servers come along very infrequently. the meat itself seems to be either rare-blue or cooked to death. their beef, both sirloin and tri tip, was both seared to a crisp on the outside and almost blue-raw inside. the chicken drumsticks are covered in leather-like skin and the ""house-made pork sausage with fennel and garlic"" is a gritty, dry hunk of regular american breakfast sausage that makes a mcsausage look tasty. 

the only saving grace about the food at pampas is the roasted pineapple, which was delicious and sweet.

onto the service, the waitress ignored our table for the bulk of our 2 hour meal. she ignored our requests for more napkins and water, despite us directly addressing her. all the while, she made great conversation will the table next to ours, laughing and joking more than the next three tables combined. when she did finally bring us one refill of water to the carafe, it was clearly tainted. the water was sour and smelled like gasoline. because of our waitress' negligence, we had to ask once of the other servers for fresh water, which as expected, never came. 

finally, we weren't going to waste any more time with our waitress and were going out to pay at the hostess station when she scurried over to let us pay for our meal. no pleasantries, no apology for the tainted water, just swipe the card, throw the receipt at us and walk away. this was the worst meal and restaurant i have ever been to in las vegas. the price is high for you to just fill up on canned pasta and bread to just be ignored.",1,0,0.9954450789996951

12/29/17

had 5:00pm reservations. got here about 4:45pm and were seated immediately. we were starving so inhaled our first round in about 20mins.  kind of disappointed in us bc we could only go 1 round! we were stuffed! 

the meat guys were a little too quick for my liking to slice and dash. a couple of times they just piled things. i don't like that, but whatever. 

waiter: i think his name was sean (we started with one guy who may have gone on break bc we ended with another guy). all the staff was extremely nice and attentive. 

shrimp: excellent 

sirloin:  absolute favorite. juicy with great flavor.

tri tip:  i thought it was a little dry. the man thought it was very good and flavorful.

pork tenderloin:  i thought it was decent. i didn't finish my piece, though. the man thought it was a little on the dry side

sausage:  crispy on the outside; juicy and flavorful on the inside

bacon-wrapped filet mignon:  i love bacon but wasn't really feeling this. the man said, ""almost anything bacon-wrapped is good!"" to each his own. ‍
lamb:  first-time trying lamb. nope. not lamb fans. 

chicken:  i didn't try it. the man said the skin was nice and crispy but dry on the inside. 

ham: didn't try

salad bar:  good variety of cheese, pasta, rice, salad, and sides.

water:  excellent! i don't like water, but this was good! nice and refreshing.

guarana soda:  first time trying and it wasn't bad. refreshing; tasted like carbonated apple juice, sooooo apple cider.  (got free with my yelp checkin)

bathroom:  disappointing! was definitely in need of some maintenance and it did not smell very nice, at all.  the man said the men's restroom was ok.

picture person! this time, though, the lady didn't get irritated when i said ""no thanks"" to buying the big pictures. she was super friendly. 

 because not all the meats met our expectation from our past experiences at other brazilian steakhouses.
overall: decent. we will eat here again, especially with a bogo! 

ok -- time to roll me out .....

** update **

12/31/17

we were invited back by arash for lunch and seated in the private room. erica was our server. first thumbs up because she was amazing!!

all the meat and seafood was served hot and fresh. 

their salad buffet was still amazing. this time, someone was constantly cleaning up and replenishing. excellent bc people can be messy at buffets. 

* bacon-wrapped chicken: yes!
* sausage: yes!
* garlic mashed potatoes: yes!
* sautéed mushrooms: yes!
* sirloin: yes! plus i mixed it with my salad = excellent steak salad!
* tilapia: yes!
* mussels: both mine and the man's first time trying - different but not bad! they were served in a tomato-based sauce so you can taste the tomato. mixed with mashed potato, they were very good.
* salmon: i am allergic to salmon but the man said yes! best salmon he's had in a long time. it is topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce which they make in-house and he said it is excellent.
* ham: yes!
* chicken: in my previous review, this chicken was on the dry side. today, omg! the chefs nailed it! super moist and the skin! yes!
* tri-tip: yes! i got an end-fatty piece = eye-rolling omg! so much flavor and tenderness.
* pork tenderloin: yes! much better flavor than last time!

so -- after all this, i had to unbutton my jeans; everything was so good, i wanted to try more! so, here it goes:

* chicken tortilla soup: good. the chicken was just a tad dry, but that can happen when it's continually heating. the flavor was on point!
* corn chowder: amazing!
* tortellini salad: yes!
* asian pasta salad: first-time trying! different taste but very good.
* italian pasta salad: yes!
* green beans: yes! 
* garbanzo beans: spicy for me (i'm a total spice lightweight), but good flavor!
* basil tomato: yes!
* basil carrots: yes!
* couscous salad: yes!
* cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake: eye-rolling omg!

bathroom: yes! the men's room was being cleaned - the women's room had a fresh clean smell and was neat and tidy; as it should be! yes!

way to go arash and pampa's! you have exceeded our expectation! everything was absolutely amazing! thank you for the vip experience! the next time we are in vegas, we will definitely make this a spot to eat!

XWxS1NVNfXKEGxlpfRd_Zw,2019,"first of all, i must say i was nervous about this place after reading some of the reviews below, but i had already committed to a ""deal"" on another website (you probably get my drift).  actually tried to return the other deal but it was just a little too late.  so glad i couldn't return it, we had a great meal and overall great experience!  

we went on friday evening, 1/25/19.  we did not have a reservation and had to wait about 7 minutes to be seated.  it appeared that most tables were occupied at that time.  our server paris was great, and luz (our roaming caipirinha mixer that night) returned to our table later in the meal to check if we wanted any more caipirinha drinks (i tipped her well the first time around), which i did so she whipped another one out right away.  also had one of each sangria which were included in the deal.  5 drinks with one meal is plenty for me (though luz offered to make more caipirinhas and paris offered to bring more sangria).  

all items in the salad bar were stocked when we went through.  it is not as large as at some other brazilian steakhouses, but there is plenty to (over)fill up on before starting in on the meat.  i thought all the items i selected were fine, though i'm not the pickiest eater.  i did think the cheese cubes were a bit strange like a previous reviewer, but my steak knife cut them easily.  :-)

the passadores came by frequently.  and i do mean frequently.  i lost count of how many times, but it was generally every couple of minutes, even when we were full.  one time, one of the boys even returned a few minutes later with a few pieces of filet mignon which he had not been carrying but brought at our special request!  absolutely nothing to complain about regarding this part of the meal, unless you would complain about being offered too much meat too often.  we were not given an indicator, they just kept coming.  the sirloin in particular was very good and very tender, though obviously too rare for my wife's taste but she tried it anyway and agreed it was excellent.  when a later passadore served some well-done sirloin, she agreed with me it was better rare.  we did not try the pork items but thought all the beef, chicken and lamb items were good.  and roasted pineapple is always a treat.  we also had the tilapia (paris brought that) which was fine but nothing special.  it is a brazilian steakhouse after all.  

the cheesecake dessert was on par with any other restaurant, no complaints there either.

we do try to be good customers and be nice to the waitstaff to help attract ""niceness"" back, but this really was plain and simple good service (no vestige of any of the negative things i read in other reviews here).  i'm sorry to all those who clearly had a different experience.  i can't help but think their ratings will be coming up, if our experience is how things will be going forward.  it will be on our list for future trips based on our experience this time.",5,1,0.03727831173501761

0wxjmtCTlFtmlbUPUwutrA,2010,"this is my first trip to las vegas and pampas was the first restaurant we ate at.  we were trying to find a sports bar as it was sunday at 1pm and we wanted wings and football.  we walked the entire miracle mile shopping center and the two main sports bars, blondie's and pbr rock bar, were packed.  we were really hungry by this time, so we stopped at pampas.

we were promptly seated at the very front/patio area of the restaurant.  the salad bar is all the way in the back of the restaurant.  my husband is disabled and walks with crutches, so i was already planning my strategy to get his plate and my plate all the way across the restaurant.  our server arrived, noticed the crutches, and immediately asked if we would be ordering the salad bar and, if so, would we like to be seated closer?  this scored major points with me.  they actually opened a section for us to sit in, and we had it all to ourselves.

we both ordered the surf and turf and hit the salad bar.  the only other churrascaria i have been to is fogo de chao, so that is where i will base my comparison.  the salad bar at pampas is about 1/4 of the size of the one at fogo.  i actually found this preferable as i remember being completely overwhelmed at fogo.  the pampas salad bar had a nice selection - jicama and citrus salad, brazilian coleslaw, pasta salads, potato salads, hearts of palm salad and several others.  for a more traditional salad, there was an option of romaine or spring mix.  the romaine was dark green, crisp and fresh and the spring mix was equally fresh - not soggy at all.  all of the basic salad toppings were available and several dressing options were available.  my only complaint about the salad bar would be that the fresh mozzarella balls (presented with cherry tomatoes) were very bland.

on to the main reason we were there...meat!  by the time i returned from the salad bar, the sirloin guy had already been by and had left a delicious slice of perfectly cooked, medium rare meat on my plate.  it was seasoned just right and very tasty.  i ended up eating a lot of that sirloin.  there was also bacon-wrapped turkey (can't go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon!), brazilian sausage, ham, bbq chicken, bbq pork and even pineapple!  all of the meat was well seasoned and well cooked.  

i had noticed one of the menu options was a skirt steak with chimichurri.  i asked our server if i could get a side of chimichurri and she was happy to oblige.  she let me know it would take a few minutes because they make it fresh for each order.  it came out a couple minutes later and was delicious!  

the ""surf"" part of the surf and turf was ok.  when you order the surf and turf they bring a platter of seafood to the table and let you know you can order more of anything.  the inital platter includes grilled shrimp, scallops, salmon and the fresh catch of the day (not sure what it was - i think it was grouper, which i don't care for).  the shrimp were small but tasty, the salmon was well cooked and made even better by the provided soy ginger glaze.  i didn't try the catch of the day.  the scallops were very small and not very good....can't quite put my finger on it, but i ate one and didn't want anymore.  overall, i would say save a few dollars and just get the meat.

there was a woman who was around during our entire visit...i believe she was either the owner or the general manager.  she stopped by our table to make sure we were satisfied and talked to us a little about the restaurant.  i commented on the chimichurri and she stated that everything is made fresh, in house.  in fact, i had noticed a window into the kitchen while i was at the salad bar where i could see people making all of the salad bar items.  anyway, i always appreciate when i am in a restaurant and the owner or manager is interested enough in making sure the guests are happy that they stop by and chat.

when we checked in to our hotel, the concierge gave us two $5 off coupons for pampas.  i am sure we will be using those before we leave vegas at the end of the week.  at $19.99 for the meat-only option, its hard to beat for lunch.  if you go for dinner, it is more than double the price ($41.95 for meat only) but they add tenderloin, tri-tip beef, and lamb.  i have to admit...i am tempted.",4,1,0.00995626666937155

their salad bar is puny but that could be forgivable since it isn't the main attraction anyway. right away, however, our waiter seemed to be on a pressure-tactic to try and upgrade us to some surf-n-turf mumbojumbo that we had no interest in. when we politely declined, he seemed to visibly dismiss us but didn't miss a beat to try and slickly pressure us into buying bottled water. i'm not a fan of tap water anyway, so it was no big deal, but he definitely came off as a used car sales rep-level slimy.

the gauchos came around once and....that was about it. we were really early for dinner, right at 5, and there weren't many other people there, so it was really puzzling to me as to why they couldn't be found. i wanted more of the steak and fatty meats, but they only ones that came by a second time were the dry chicken guys and the underwhelming sausage dudes. since we had a show to catch at 630, we really couldn't linger anyway. 

all in all, i wouldn't come back here - the meat was too rare, the service was lacking, the cold food was bland without enough variety, and i wasn't satisfied. the one standout was the brazilian lemonade - we couldn't get enough.

oh yeah - they will come by and try and take a picture of you before you leave, ""complimentary souvenir postcard."" once you pay your bill they'll show you 2 large printouts that are $25 each or 2 for $30 as a 'vegas keepsake.' uh...what happened to the whole gratis part? that's when they'll whip out a tiny 2"" x 2"" print out and again with the high-pressure sales pitch. very, very tacky. they also photoshop you without asking so you look like a cartoon character. skip this place if you can.",2,0,0.9977994702955278

the lunch menu has only 7 meats compared to 11 (i think) for dinner. at lunch time, the meats were pretty fresh and none were overcooked. i didn't try the seafood so i can't say if its any good. if there's insufficient turnover, i could easily see how some of the other diners experienced overcooked or dried out meats. 

the bbq chicken and spicy chicken were both great and normally, i don't really care for chicken. i could do without the bacon-wrapped turkey, but i've never been a fan of bacon-wrapped anything. just give me the bacon. 

i will say the salad bar is a bit on the ""light"" side. i've been to a similar place in san diego ($50/person for dinner) and the bar was twice the size. the mozzarella and tomato ""salad"" was ok, but not great. i'd say the deli counter at von's/safeway is better.

to start, we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table in the near-empty dining room. the gauchos who serve the meat were rude and instead of asking us to move our plates, they put their plates down and shoved ours around with the plate. they also mumbled and half the time i wasn't sure what exactly i was eating. and if you get the surf and turf option, they just plop all the seafood from the spear down on to your plate. and the shrimp is still in the shell, so you get to peel it.

pros
- they actually serve seafood. salmon and the shrimp was the best. mahi mahi was over cooked. 

cons
- portion size is too much. like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. if i'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, i'd stick w texas de brazil or fogo de chao (it be cheaper and way better food)

- majority of the meat i had was too well done making it hard and chewy. bbq pork wreaked of bo aftertaste. thank goodness it came last cause i lost my appetite. i literally thought the smell was from the waiter but i was wrong lol

- floor is super slippery

- bar selection is not great (food and space wise). the layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style. the fried banana was gross because it just like they breaded a regular banana vs using plantain.

rUv4xsnkXacf7tHbmdsePw,2012,"my husband and i went to pampas last night for dinner and had a wonderful experience! the customer service was superb. as soon as we sat down, we were greeted by our server, marco. the food began arriving at our table immediately. all of the food servers were very friendly. the meats and seafood were absolutely delicious. in addition, the salad bar had a wide variety of different options and was very colorful. jack, the restaurant manager, came to our table to see how we were enjoying our meal, and we were very impressed with his level of customer service. we give pampas our highest recommendation!
on a side note, we found a groupon coupon for pampas- buy one, get one ultimate surf and turf dinner. we saved approximately $50 on our meal. in addition to the surf and turf, we received one appetizer and dessert. we ordered the ceviche, which was made with coconut milk and was outstanding! we ordered the tiramisu for dessert, and found room for it even though we were stuffed. 
what a great experience we had at pampas! we'll definitely return.",5,1,0.0005242953502788694
I854XN51I4OrYP8ij0UPyQ,2017,"place is very crowded and overpriced.  they set the price at $71 per person and tell you at the door that they are offering you a 2-4-1 deal to make you think you're getting a great deal.  this place isn't even worth it at what they say is 1/2 price.

waiter comes to table with a carafe of water and pours everyone a glass of water but doesn't tell you that they charge $1 per person for the water.  you find that out when they bring you the check.

ordered a glass of house wine at $8 and it was served in plastic.  yes they used plasticware to serve the wine in.  ordered a beer, the beer was in a can, waiter places the beer can inside the glass and puts in front of you and expects you to pour your own beer in the glass.  at least the beer glass was made of glass unlike the plastic wine glass.

waiter brings the check, not in a check folder, just plops the printed check on the table.  i look at check and the recommended tip amount is based on the overpriced $71 per person plus drinks and water.  needless to say i didn't leave a tip that large.

placed my credit card with the check, handed it to the waiter.  waiter hands it back to me and says you need to add the tip.  so waiter stands there and watched as i add the tip.  because of that tacky move i reduced the tip even further.

i will never return to this place and do not recommend it.

the salad bar is uninspired and bland. 

i went for surf & turf lunch. they have one beef based meat to choose from, then lots of cheaper cuts filling in the rest of the rotation. i felt sorry for the ""roasted ham"" guy, going from table to table, begging people to take a slice of ham from him.  the chicken was tasteless, the bacon wrapped turkey had soggy bacon.  the actual steak tasted ok, but the fat in the cut had not been rendered down, resulting in a really chewy mess.

the ""surf"" part of the meal was a disaster.  the salmon was old and fishy. the tilapia was not cooked through.  the shrimp was rubbery.  i do have to say the bacon wrapped scallops weren't terrible. the plate went almost entirely untouched.

it was difficult to get my water refilled.  for lunch, they had us sit in a section of the restaurant as far away from the salad bar as possible, resulting in many pilgrimages across the empty restaurant for the deep fried bananas (the best thing on the salad bar).

the advertisement says steak and seafood.  should have been steak or seafood.  apparently you can't get both without paying an extra supplement, something that wasn't explained in advance.  only on very rare occasions have i been talked ""down to"" by a waiter and made to feel like serving me was beneath him. this guy was definitely in the wrong occupation.  he personality was better suited to being a tire mechanic. 

the food was ""ok"" nothing to brag about.  the servers worked on a pattern of ""feast or famine"".  they came by too frequently, followed by long periods of nothing.  the buffet salad and vegetable bar was also, ""just ok"", nothing special or worth filling up with. over all there was a lot of meat, however, i didn't think that it was top cuts, some pieces were a bit chewy!  did i mention that it was off the beaten path, located in a mall at the end of a branch that lead nowhere. 

this meal was planned to be our highlight of our eating out on the strip.  we were all disappointed and felt that we could have done better eating somewhere else.  

to add insult to injury, the waiter presented the check to  one of the ladies in out group of two couples.  how does a waiter make a mistake like that?  since it was my treat to the four diners, i felt insulted that he chose to give her the check.  i think that she felt obligated to participated in the bill so she insisted on leaving the tip.  it was hard for me to say no to her given the table dynamics.  the whole thing ended in an ugly sean with her male counterpart telling her to stop interfering with my part of handling the check and payments. no, i will never return even for a free meal.",2,0,0.9994928875867622

the service at the host desk was extremely slow. we had reservations at 5pm and scoping around the rather small dining hall, there were plenty of empty tables. however, the hosts still made us wait about 30 minutes past our reservation time of 5pm.

the food was just okay. the quality of the meat really lacked flavor and good texture. it probably didn't help that the servers who were serving the meat did not know how to cut the meat properly and butchered it.

9pp4KBiwQfRIiHqzypQSsQ,2011,"was given a coupon to this place by one of the numerous trolls they pay to pass fliers out on the strip. the coupon was 'buy one dinner get another free which the coupon says would be 31.95 instead of 60+ dollars so long as you buy 2 soft drinks. that sounded like a pretty good deal. so we schlep on over to the restaurant. 

we get seated and looking over the menu notice that  perhaps the advertised deal was not what it seems. dinner for one is 60+ so the deal now seams to be buy 1 dinner for 51.95 plus drinks to get the other free. 
for that price, i could have gone to the wynn or similar casino and had dinner at the name chef restuarants.... just saying.

i call the waitress over and ask her about the coupon to which she replies '""a lot of people think that it's 31.95 plus two drinks but it's actually 51.95"". now, my command of english is pretty good if i may say so myself, and having been to law school and all that, i think intelligent enough. so it seems to me that they deliberately mislead people as to what the price will be and hope that once you get there you'll be too embarrased or resigned to leave. so i left.

funny though, that the same restuarant also has a breakfast special of 5.95 for steak, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes and a pastry, yet want to charge 51.95 for their dinner. uh, ok. in the las vegas magazines, the place is rated $$ which seems a bit inaccurate too.",2,0,0.9839073770420529

the food was slightly better than i was expected, but some of the cuts were criminally overcooked. the tri-tip, top sirloin, and bacon-wrapped chicken were my favorites. the meat quality is below that of fogo de chao or m-grill.

while the waitress was quick to refill our drinks, forgetting the shrimp was annoying. the servers bringing out the meat were friendly and prompt.

with bogo coupon, an appetizer, and drinks, lunch was around $90. that's normal for this type of restaurant. without the coupon, it would have been ridiculously overpriced.

the salad bar wasn't that good, it had soups, salads, breads, i didn't care to fill up on because i was saving my stomach for meat.

when it came out, it was chicken, chicken wrapped in bacon, pork, some tough beef...and i think that was it, some other combinations of pork..basically all the inexpensive meats. i only enjoyed this tender beef one, don't remember what it was called. but compared to chama guacha, foco de chao, texas de brazil...this was a baby....but for $12 it was decent.

also rich, who was one of the gentleman that brought out meat to us was very helpful and nice. 

these two employees are the reasons why i didn't give a . unfortunately we came for the meat. i'm not sure if they were understaffed or don't know how to cook the meat. 

the meat was charred on a very thin layer on the outside and rare underneath. meaning they turned up the flames to put meat out quick and was actually just burning the steaks on the outside. as soon as they cut the meat at the table  it was just raw underneath. not even medium just raw. just went from burnt to raw. i didn't eat a lot of the meat because it wasn't cooked. each time someone came by i asked if i could get medium well or well. no one brought my well until i asked rich. he personally cooked me some and plated it and brought it to me. true service.

 i recommend looking for the showgirl handing out the coupons not too far from the restaurant entrance in planet hollywood.  the coupon saves you almost 50% per adult and it is good for your whole party.

the only reason i did not give it  was because the shrimp we receive was overcooked and the filet mignon was too well done.  however, everything else was excellent.  we travel to vegas quite often and we will most certainly be back!

the vegas guides give this restaurant a $$.  however, at $35+ per person with coupon, $60+ without, i would give it a $$$.",4,1,0.0074632576041193666

8njeJlisvEQMjsgF3M1BQw,2015,"we've visited thew few brazilian style steak houses in vegas, and this was hands down the worst of them all. the main reason we decided to try this place is because we had a buy one get one free coupon, which they ended up only honoring $50 of the $58 price. so onto experience. dinner started off by seating us in the corner of the bar at a table that you'd find in some cheap dive restaurant. the chairs were hard, lopsided, and kept sliding on the slick floor. after being seated we went to the salad bar to start our meal. the variety at the salad bar was meager at best. it included cheese rolls (even though just brought out, i could play baseball with them), mashed potatoes that i could re-stucco my house with, flavorless mozzarella balls, and house dressing so thick it wouldn't slide off the spoon. so sometime in the 10 minutes or so we were up at the salad bar, a plate of mystery fish, salmon, shrimp, and mussels was dropped off at our table. there was 10 shells in the mussel plate, of which 8 were empty. my 2 mussels were not half bad though. the shrimp was still fully shelled including legs, and overcooked making them too tough to enjoy, was like eating rubber. mystery fish was cold after sitting there so we didn't try it at all. we did try 11 of their meats, but we had to ask for them each time. they regularly brought around the cheaper meats (chicken and pork), but we had to specifically ask for the picanha (the brazilian grills signature meat) garlic steak, filet wrapped in bacon, etc. the chicken was passable, and the pork sausage was rather good (but i don't come to a brazilian steak restaurant for its sausage) the best food of the night was definitely the picanha, but it was no where near the best i've had in vegas. the service was another part of the night that was sub par. our drinks were constantly empty and we would have to ask twice for things like sugar. we'd ask for certain meats and the waiters would just forget about us, and we'd have to ask 2-3 more waiters to get things to happen. we sat for almost 30 minutes waiting for picanha before we gave up for the night. the wait staff seemed confused as well. they brought special ordered food to our table we didn't order, and we saw them actually placing people's orders on empty tables and the waiters coming back 10-15 mins later and giving the food to the right person. overall this place was horrible. even with $50 off our $116 meal i felt like i was ripped off. if you're looking for a nice classy brazilian all you can eat steak place, check out via brasil. we've been there probably 20-30 times, and it's great every time.",1,0,0.9931544179297565

VG8Fv_KGGQUWEm3_VQz8sg,2016,"the review is not a reflection of the food or the service, it's the presentation of the buy one get one deal, which is shameful.

you walk into a dark alley, and a well dressed, clean shaven, nice looking man, his face partly obscured by the poor lighting approaches.  you take a deep breath, and start taking larger and quicker steps.  he leans over, and whispers in your ear: ""how about a great brazilian dinner at half price, my friend?"".


you make your best uninterested gesture, but your face screams: ""tell me more"".  so he does.


$34.99 includes all you can eat grilled brazilian meats, perhaps twenty kinds of them.  that's 50% off!  you're hungry, it's hot, you almost surrender.  but the nice man goes on: ""free access to the buffet, which has forty kinds of side dishes, fruits and vegetables, and even more meat"".


""one minute"" you say, and turn to consult with the family.  where's the family?  they're gone.  instead i see three full size lions, their teeth sharp, their tongues hanging out, drooling all over the place.  ""yes"", i say to the nice man.  ""yes!!!"".


we go in, and we sit down, and our waitress, sorry, our server, comes by for introductions and instructions.


""in order to use your half price deal, you must order an alcoholic drink from the drink menu"", she opens.  ""wait"", i say, ""the nice man never mentioned that"".  the server says calmly: ""nonetheless, this is the deal"".  we pretend to consider, but everyone knows there is no way back now.  we surrender.  we order a beer, a lemon drop, and whatever for the kids who aren't allowed alcohol anyway.


then we visit the buffet, and bring the loot to the table.  then a marching band of meat carrying young men walk by us, at the rate of one per minute with the most delicious meats we had in a very long time.  garlic sirloin, coated chicken, lamb, filet mignon, sausage, and many more mouthwatering meats are dropped into our plates and devoured in no time.


wow, it's really amazing.  the excellent meats and the alcohol, make us forget the nice man in the dark alley.  we almost forgive him.  until we see the check.


the check puts you in a very compromising position.  it actually registers the amount without the discount (we would never set foot in this restaurant without the discount), and with the discount, but with the drinks that we were forced to order, and then makes a very silly proposition: you can choose a tip amount of 30% on the amount before discount, or 30% of the amount after discount.


at this point, despite the excellent meal and the alcohol, we realize: we've been cleverly lured into a very flavorful trap, and the only way out is to pay the ransom and move on.


so here's my review.  if you want a great meal, at a good restaurant, on the strip in the heart of las vegas, and you are prepared to pay about $60.00 per person, go for it.  dinner was quite good indeed.  but if you think that a promise of a man in the alley will get you a great dinner at half price, you got another thing coming my friend.

X1pLlsKkp6S61m_UNoQACA,2018,"surprisingly one of the cheaper brazilian steak house options, especially for it being on the strip. this place is located inside the miracle mike shops right next to the new buffalo wild wings. meat lovers.. please, step right on up. 

pampas is a mother's day tradition for my family & me because they have such a good deal: bogo free meat rodizio. for brazilian steak house newbies, the meat rodizio is generally the most popular option. this is where you see the men walking around with stacks of meat & slicing them for you on your plate. there is a slight difference between the selection of meats for lunch, what my family & i chose, and for dinner.

there is also a little salad bar in the back with various salads & a several hot items as well. one of my favorites being the pan de queso (i know that's not portuguese, but i forgot what the exact name is). it's this delicious cheese bread that's kind of like a pop over, with cheese in the dough, slightly over baked on the outside for the crispness & then fluffy & airy pockets of yum on the inside. i can just go there to eat those things, they're too good.

although the meats are served and sliced at the table, it is all you can eat style. so as long as the people keep coming around, you can keep eating. some of the meats we ate were the house sirloin, pork sausage, chicken wrapped in bacon, tri-tip & parmesan crusted filet mignon. 

i would have given , but the seating arrangement was a little too tight. we sat right in front by the main door of the restaurant, so we had a lot of foot traffic passing thru our table. aside from that, there were also smaller couple tables surrounding our table & i could only imagine how less intimate it would be for a couple to be sitting back to back with another. also, after a while i had to ask our server to have some more meat pass our way...

i would recommend if you've never experience a brazilian steak house on a budget compared to other chains that are pricier. this way, you'll understand the experience of it all & if you decide to try more expensive options you'll be more familiar with the environment.",4,1,0.0007972946585634855
-8T63nXHIEIolEL0xBR5qA,2017,"while we were in vegas, we received a coupon for lunch at pampas.  i was especially excited because i had been telling my husband how much i loved brazilian bbqs.  

the restaurant is located in that new miracle mile mall thing, kind of down a short hallway from the main circle.  upon walking up to the entrance, there were two ladies standing in front.  one lady welcome us and the other asked if we were there because we had a coupon.  it was a little odd, but ok.  we told her that we did have a lunch coupon and she explained that the coupon was only good for a sandwich, but we could do an upgrade for $20 to have the actual brazilian bbq.  we opted for that.  

once we were seated, a woman came to our table with a fancy glass bottle and poured water into a couple of glasses and asked if we wanted something else to drink.  we both ordered iced tea and the brazilian bbq meal, which included the buffet area in the back of hot and cold dishes.  they were ok, but nothing to write home about.  we noticed that there was quite a bit of time between ""meat"" guys coming around.  it felt like of like they were hoping you would only sample a couple things and leave.  i could totally be wrong, but that is how it felt.  
about half way through our meal, a lady with a camera approached us and asked if we wanted to have a complimentary photo postcard.  we agreed.  a few minutes later she brought us a print-out of our photo on basic photo paper and began showing us photos of us in little paper frames she was selling for $20.  we kept saying no thank you until she said she would give them both to us for $10.  it was pretty annoying to be propositioned during our meal, but i guess everyone has to have a hustle.  

another annoyance was the fact that they were vacuuming the room with a loud vacuum while we were trying to enjoy our meal.

at the end of our meal, the bill came and they had charged us for water!  we didn't ask for water, the girl poured it without even asking if we wanted it...and we were charged for it.  my husband was very upset, not really about the $1 added to our bill, but the fact that they would sneak that into our meal. he spoke to who we think was the manager about the annoyances, but he was kind of rude about it and mentioned that we used a coupon.  what does that have to do with anything?!

tgh58mQyzPPdf2RTqeLgZg,2014,"we had a free dinner voucher here, but it didn't include the rodizio....damn. that's pretty much the only reason i'd want to hit up a brazilian steakhouse. it did include sirloin with mashed potatoes and the salad bar, so we plowed onward, but it was the most underwhelming experience our entire time in vegas. we left glad that we didn't pay $43 + tax & tip for bad food and slow service.

our food took an hour to come out. half hour into the order, we were notified that the computer went down, and our order hadn't been sent back to the kitchen. ten minutes later, the kitchen was ""working on plating it"", and yet it took another 20 minutes. what the hell were they doing back there? the meat is presumably already cooked since the servers are walking around the restaurant with it, and the plating was nothing special - just sliced meat on a plate - so why did it take 30 more minutes on top of the computer failure? barely made our show.

the salad bar was odd. there were caesar salar makings, but no caesar dressing. there was sweet and sour chicken (at a brazilian place?) and some pastas, but few enticing veggies. i piled on the potatoes and carbed it up. we grabbed some cheese bread (pao de quiejo), usually heavenly, but it was very over cooked, downright crunchy, and hard. the sirloin was good, but not wait-an-hour good...

two gentlemen next to us at the bar had the rodizio, but it was served onto tiny plates, and they kept having to flag down servers as they went by.

adding to that was there really wasn't any in-between as far as ""done"" goes...rare or well...nothing else.

ujYYuxHvlMdhl-m6bcODdA,2013,"bought a coupon for this restaurant at tixfortonight as it seemed a good place to try out. suffice it to say we were very pleased with the service, variety and general deliciousness that greeted us. 


my first impression of pampas was style over substance; in that regard i was very much mistaken. yes, it is a fancy restaurant with a matching feel, however it is also warm, welcoming and infused with an overall pleasant feel. our waiter dave was a consummate professional. our drinks were never empty and were strong and crisp. despite the fact we had only an hour open bar we were met with no delays and were given precisely as much as we could drink in that time. his service was beyond reproach. what's more the servers and managers were also very on the ball, asking us consistently how we were enjoying our meal and if everything was to our satisfaction. the service here really was  quality.

as for the food: superb! the salad bar was fully stocked with more pasta, vegetables and sides than you could ask for. you could very easily and happily indulge only in the sides and still have a very satisfying, delicious meal without fault. however, to do so would be to miss out on the main event of truly sensational, high quality meats brought and served at your table. my particularly favourite was the perfectly cooked sirloin and yummy spicy chicken. but all the meats were divine and well worth the extra money, if only for the variety and unlimited quantity you receive. my only fear is that this place was somewhat wasted on me due to my small appetite. but if you're a big eaten then i can promise this place will not dissapoint.
 
fair warning though: pampas (as you might expect considering the unlimited nature and remarkable quantity) does come with a hefty price tag. it cost us $130 for the two of us (and that was including the discount). expect to pay big.

BwCtz_cAoXT3NnA2vYsr-A,2019,"the food was great, although a bit pricey, especially being that you couldn't take home what was already on your plate (- at least for the unlimited meat option). 

the service was ""okay"" from our waiter jake, but exceptional from one of the pasadors (walter). we asked both our waiter and walter on the status of our food that was taking a long time, and walter was the only of the two that came back each time giving us updates, whereas jake didn't come back until i caught him in passing to ask for the check. 

walter was exceptional and was very attentive to our requests. 
he went out of his way to figure out for me a specific steak that i had tried when the pasadors had first started rounds on our table. 

i've rated a 4/5, thanks to walter's service and of course, the food. 
- for the service from our waiter and the wasteful rule of not being able to have a takeaway box for your food for specific meals. 

going to las vegas for a vacation, your experiences (& the food) are part of what makes vegas memorable. thanks to walter, our experience at pampas was a lot better than what it would've been with only jake waiting on us.

now on to the sucky part:
bad meat all around. too dry or not flavorful enough. we ordered the 10 course (iirc) meat dinner and maybe 1 or 2 were actually good.

for the quality of food, this place is a little pricy even for vegas (at least the dinners are). 


i can understand if the negatives are small things like ambiance or maybe the service. but when the food itself isn't that good then you've got a problem. i'm by no means an expert when it comes to brazilian food, but i've had much much better.

UG7VL_LZb5zFKV3ULjUEeA,2013,"i'd been hearing from work folks that brazilian bbqs are the bomb.  being a vegetarian there isn't anything for me at the ones back home so i've never been or been able to attend with my carnivorous sweetie. 

the nice part of pampas is they have a large buffet salad bar with tons of options that are veggie and will do a vegetarian rodizio up if requested so i figured it would be a nice place to take my carnivore while not starving myself.

carnivore man ordered the surf and turf and i ordered up the veggie skewer.  honestly my veggie skewer was boring and the part i enjoyed was a few dishes from the buffet which was acceptable and i didn't leave hungry to say the least.  

my fiance was in heaven at least until the seafood skewer appeared and they put shark on his plate.   he was very upset to learn they serve shark as he's morally opposed to the shark fishing industry.  for this reason i'm not sure he'd ever make a return trip to pampas.  i wouldn't ever choose pampas on my own accord but would still attend with someone who'd get the full experience out of it. 

if you can swing it,  visit at lunch because the food seems the same but it's double the price at dinner time.   lunch is kind of expensive for a vegetarian like myself but it's reasonable for the surf and turf or just the turf in my estimation.  you'll find coupons a plenty for this place -  from 5% off and 2 for 1 dinners is what i've seen.   5% is a better deal at lunch and 2 for 1 makes it lunch priced if you go for dinner.",3,1,0.3892296935565449

we celebrated my brother in-law's birthday here last week & had a horrible time. first, our waiter was very impatient to get everybody's drink order. he had a huge attitude with several guests as they were going back & forth asking questions about cocktails. but after everyone was finished ordering (a table of about 15) we went to the salad bar to start. the salad bar had some hot items and a good variety of appetizer-esque dishes. 
cut to about 30 minutes later when our drinks finally arrived... awful! didn't even bother drinking the nasty cocktail that was served. good thing we didn't want anything else because our waiter never returned to the table!!!!!! we were a large party there for about 2+ hours and only saw our waiter when he took the drink orders & then when the bill was paid.... wtf!?
next the meat started to arrive... finally we would ""get our monies worth""... wrong. meat was bland, overcooked & of poor quality. you would think a brazilian steakhouse would offer quality proteins, maybe that was too much to ask. 
while the majority of us went with the surf & turf a member of our party had ordered a simply medium rare fillet mignon with a potato side which took over an hour to arrive. by which time we were ready to pack our bags so we got it boxed to go & our friend left without eating a thing.

we were given coupons for bogo on the $44 lunch so 5 of us decided to take advantage of that offer and one of us just wanted soup, $44 lunch... gotta be good, let's go!
right off the bat, if that wasn't canned soup i wouldn't want to admit i made it!  nice salad bar, not great but no complaints there. the rolls they put out weren't worth eating  but why fill up on bread anyway, we're expecting some great meat coming around anytime now. 
first they brought some shrimp out for the table, not bad but my husband was really the only one eating it.  then they brought the sausage around, excellent!
roast, and the sirloin, ummm, let's say i tried a couple bites and thought i'd save room for the next dish.  ham came around, not bad, not great. chicken... took a look and passed.  there was a very tasty steak (the star of the show) that was actually very good, that and the sausage were really the only meats worth eating. 
$3.50 a glass for very flat soda, mandatory to use the coupon.  (along with a $1 per person ""water conservation"" charge)...  seriously?!? when the waitress came around (she was very nice btw), we explained that the soda was completely flat and maybe they needed to change the co2. she said they have but they've been having a lot of trouble with it.  really, this $3.50 flat soda is mandatory?  when the bill came we had asked to split it in half and pay with 2 cards (mine and my daughters), i guess half meant something else to her. anyway... soda, i did explain that we felt taken being forced to order $17.50 of flat soda and they should be ashamed of themselves.  i did this while standing over my flat diet coke and my flat sprite that i had barely taken a couple of sips of.  she said she would talk to the manager. she came back with $7 cash since she couldn't fix the bill. that's ok, but $7?  ""oh you want it all back?"" of course we do! i told her don't worry about 1 of them, our teenage grandson didn't mind... teen boys just drink it, fair enough there!

""well abuse that seafood, then!"" was his reply. this remark actually made me giggle.

the buffet selection was decent, although i wished they had more salad greens.

the manager, was quite attentive, and he was quick to remedy the situation with the seafood by providing us with a freshly, properly cooked skewer. he even comped us dessert (this policy must be standard in the manager 101 handbook) we had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was decidedly more cheesecake than white chocolate. it was beautifully presented on the plate with a raspberry culee and mint garnish.

overall, i would recommend this place. just make sure that the seafood is cooked to order.

overall our experience was reasonably pleasant. the staff was quite attentive (even when our ""go meat!"" indicators were turned to red they still came sound to make sure we didn't want what they were offering).

i'll start with the few positives:
-the cocktails were good. i got the sangria and my friend got a mojito. both were nice and strong and tasted good. 
-the rolls were light and fluffy and delicious (we ate a lot of these to get our money's worth)
-the dessert, a chocolate mousse pie was yummy!
now for the negatives:
-the service was slow. we had to ask for them to send over the meat carvers more than once.
-the surf part of our meal included a few dry mussels, several shrimp that were not deveined properly (seriously gross!), some fairly tasty salmon, and some mushy white fish.
-the meat was not tasty at all. the beef was fatty and hard to cut, and the pork and chicken were dry. the only good meat that i had was the sausage. 
-the side dish buffet was sparse and many dishes were empty. my friend never got any potatoes, as they were never replenished. server failed to take away our dirty dishes and they began to stack up. 
-at the end of the meal, the server came over and made sure to tell us that the value of our meal was $94, and to make sure we tipped on that amount! we are good tippers normally and as local las vegans, we know how to tip. we didn't need the lesson.
-there was $1 charge each for warm tap water that they bring in an opened water bottle. we took bets that it was just normal las vegas tap water. 
-the womens' restroom was filthy and unusable.

(15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what i would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. they were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  the restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  i am certain we could find a better place on the strip.,2,0,0.9896431671417911

2zuydfvUqAZApqVjHmnM4A,2013,"let me start by saying any place that has so many coupon users is trying to compensate for something(insert joke here)

the concept is great, ""carvers"" come out with various meats on a kabob for you to try in an all you can eat, bring it to your table buffet. a salad bar is available to fill you up*ahem* i mean to offer vegetables and there is a cart that you can order a special drink that they will make in front of you by crushing... stuff(?) together.

let me set the stage. six of us joined together to dine out and this was chosen due to a coupon that one couple had. the coupon offered 50% off our dining experience!(two for one to be exact so you need even numbers) so for $33 we could enjoy meat and shrimp or for $39 we could enjoy the full surf and turf experience. now, i'm not a mathematician, but i do know a thing or two about math but 50% off of the menu price of $50 doesn't not work out to $39...? wait? the same meal is $29 at lunch? but hey listen, this was our friends anniversary after all, let's stay in the mood... 

salad bar - come on, we all know the rules. don't fill up on the salad! i read that the salad bar is mediocre in previous posts... they were right. a salad bar with no iceberg lettuce... two choices of salad dressing - italian and something that looked like a mix of soy sauce and miso soup. but no worries, i am waiting for the steaks!

bring on the meat! the rules of the game were laid out. you get a wooden thingie with red painted on one side and green on the other. green means ""bring on the meat!"" and red means ""bugger off, i'm full!"" so you rotate it to your desired position. when we started, green definitely meant go! we were bombarded with ""carver"" after ""carver"" with shrimp, steaks, lamb, chicken with bacon, scallops... i had to turn my little ""thingie""over to red within 5 minutes. for me, the excitement kind of ended their... the meat was hard to cut with the dull knives provided. you either got rare or overcooked depending on what side of the table the carver started on and the food was ok at best. recognizing that people like meats cooked a different way, you would think a carver would ask what the preference was... but i suppose they are just carvers, we should count on our server to help... uhm.. server?

when we sat down, we hadn't decided on our drinks yet so our server said he would be back.... he forgot to mention that it could be anytime that night... we were well into our food before i could finally wave him down. after ordering and waiting another 20 or so minutes i walked to the bar and grabbed the already waiting drinks and brought them to our table of cheering lighthearted friends. we didn't see our waiter again until the end of our meal... maybe he was disguised as a carver?

good thing for the drink table travelling around! two polite girls asked us what we wanted for a special brazilian drink. not knowing what they were saying i said surprise us! they took 15 minutes to make 5 drinks. it was a good drink though, and they agreed with me, tipping their tip jar towards us so we could show our satisfaction at this concoction. wait, we didn't get a chance to try it yet... maybe come back for the tip? no? okay... here you go... 

we were enjoying each others company when a host came up with a camera and mentioned how happy we looked(maybe she was surprised?) and offered to take our picture for a ""complimentary"" photo. i had been in vegas long enough to smell a rat and i wasn't shocked when our pictures came out - $30 for the group shot or $20 for the picture of us as couples. perhaps they saw us coming a long way... they sold two pictures to our friends... my scottish roots came out as i started to clinch my wallet between one hand and my butt-cheek. 

the final bill... okay, i mentioned i wasn't a mathematician right? so i had the surf and turf, my wife had the turf and we shared three drinks between us(we would have drank more had our waiter existed) the other two couples had the same, except add one dessert each. so $39 x 6 plus desert, the added 20% gratuity, drinks maybe $8ea x 9 and two deserts for oh, we'll say $9ea = $435.... wait, what!? our friends did some math on the other side of the table and decided it best to just pay up and enjpy our night... needless to say, i won't be back. 

although the concept is good, turf service and mediocre food at surf prices earned this place every bit of the rating i gave.",1,0,0.9895596476462856

qZsm-bbN6B_3JQNgVM43RQ,2011,"**summary**
       - quality - perhaps i got a bad piece, but the meat quality of my rib eye 
       - value - save the pork ribs, the value of this place is horrendous. i paid $40 for a steak that i could easily find for $15 elsewhere. no wonder they're always having deals on restaurant.com or groupon.
       - rodizio - though i didn't get the rodizio dinner, from the looks of the meats passing by, the selection is limited compared to via brasil. with the same price as via brasil, the service and ambiance is reminiscence of your local applebees than a fine dining establishment.
**price**
       - $11.95 malagueta pork ribs
       - $39.95 rib eye steak
**ordered**
       - malagueta pork ribs - 4 succulent pork ribs over a bed of black beans and rice. it was slightly crispy on the outside  and juicy on the inside. the flavor was delightfully sweet and salty. if you're looking for a small meal, this would be the perfect choice.
       - rib eye steak - the steak comes with their buffet bar that's priced at $24.95. the buffet bar is definitely not worth that much. i'd say $10 at most. i ordered the steak medium rare and it came out as so, but it wasn't tender at all. somehow they managed to make the steak as hard as if it were cooked well done, while having a pink center.

the fact that this place costs more per person than texas de brazil is a crime, when this place is like prison food in comparison. this is the kind of place that doesn't care about excellence because they can rip tourists off and it won't matter because a new crop of unsuspecting tourists will be in the next night. seriously, just take an uber about a mile or two south to texas de brazil at town square if you want a brazilian steakhouse experience.

was gifted a groupon for surf & turf rodizio with 1 hour all you can drink. it is 8:04 pm, 44 minutes in and i have had one glass of sangria and have been waiting on a second. 

salad bar is an absolute joke and is unkempt. there is a wedding going on and the waitress told us they ran out of wine glasses, hence the back up on drinks. i even had to ask for the little card that signals we want meat or not 

i asked 3 different service people if they had chimichuri. our waitress said all they had is a-1. i didn't believe it but another guy showed us where it was supposed to be after i told him it wasn't on the salad bar like he told me it was. when it wasn't there, he asked in the kitchen and they said they ran out. it wouldn't be so egregious if they seasoned their food, but so far, everything is completely unseasoned and tepid at best. i've been offered pork tenderloin about 5 times and ham twice.

Vcc0aS6d83GNlMaryiS3Ng,2016,"after purchasing the $99 groupon for what i though would be an amazing dining experience turned into morning but a bad experience. my date and i waited 10 min for our reservation. patiently waiting to meet or server, the $25 open bar drink package, 1st drink,
came to our table 20 min later and one was incorrect. we recurve our water which had a film of grease on the top level. our first round of meat i asked for rare and was given well done. i waited an additional 10 min for the meat and correct temperate. we order the surf & turf meal option which came with small peel and eat shrimp, tilapia, as very hard piece of mahi mahi and muscles. i must say the muscles were good, i ordered another order which never came. due to the slow service we were only able to order 2 drinks on the package. i asked to speak to the manager and all that was offered was for me to return tomorrow night or when i'd like to for compensation. i shared that with all of this competition in vegas and the fact i usually go to fogo de chao which happens to be right around the corner (even more of a reason to on top of your restaurant) i did not wish to return but since we didn't finish our meals and had to leave to catch our show it would be nice to have this meal comped for our dining experience. corporate, working the flood that evening, explained i would have to go back to groupon to try to get a refund. i spoke with two other tables around me and they too said they are having ""an awful"" experience. when i spoke with the woman from corporate before leaving i shared how upset i was, the fact that nothing was able to be done for me at that moment was absolutely ridiculous. i pulled two random servers aside and asked if this is how the restaurant is and they said yes. i shared my apologies to them for having to work in such an establishment and they too responded, ""yes, this place isn't the greatest"". when i asked who was about corporate that was there and that id like their info as we are now running late for our show, she said ""you'll have to wait a moment"" and rolled her eyes at me. we waited per her request until she was finished with 3 other servers at a computer. she came back with the managing partner's business care whom i have every intentions on calling. being s local and having a culinary degree, family owned restaurants, many many friends in the casino host business and a food critic i would never recommend this establishment when fogo de chao is around the corner. 

what is advertised on groupon and what actually shows up is false advertisement since nothing looked the way they had  advertised it. 

so at the end of the day, we had to wait after making a reservation, dirty glasses and water, over cooked meat, paid $99 for two which includes surf & turf (never came with a second round of muscles i ordered). unlimited drinks for an hour (only was brought 2 drinks - one of which i had to track down someone to have them make me a 2nd drink, and dessert (which we were never offered).

i can go on and on about this place about how unhappy i was. not only did pampas ruin my date night with a terrible dinner, they also robbed me of my $99 for the meal since i wasn't told nothing could be done for me and i'd have to contact groupon. 

i have every intention of contacting the managing partner, groupon, and corporate. furthermore, being a local and knowing individuals that can refer business i have ever intention to share my story and the photos i took of our experience.",1,0,0.9984650191091174

first, we were given a hand written prize card out side the restaurant. the marketing guy said that the unlimited meats and unlimited seafood will be 42 dollars for regular days' dinner and 39.95 for dinners in christmas eve and christmas day. we showed the guy a $200 dollar restaurant gift card and asked him if we can get the christmas price if we use that specific gift card. he confirmed yes. he also confirmed that the 39.95 price is for both christmas eve and day. so i made a reservation for christmas eve and started to invite friends.
 so we, a group of 5 people showed up five mins past the schedule time. they let us waited outside for about 15 mins. fine. that's bearable.
then they took us in, gave us the menu and left. we waited for at least 10 mins before someone brought us water. for the first time ever that i get to know that the unlimited buffet on the menu says 64.95. when we were ordering, i told the sever if we can get the christmas special price. he said that it is only for christmas day. i repeated that the guy helped me made the reservation said the price is for both days. the serve apologized but said no. then i asked if we can get the 42 dollars for regular days' dinner. she said she doesn't know about that price. she said she cannot give me that price unless i show her the handwritten card i was referring to. i didn't have that with me. she said that i need to pay the 64.95 price. jerk, yeah, it was your marketing card you gave me yesterday and your front seat person who told me the christmas price. now that you just denied everything! 
we cannot let our hungry friends just leave. so we had to continue. then we went to the salad bar, i was surprised. it is just veggies with way less choices than it is at any $10-12 per person simple buffet i've been to. for a $64 buffet, you are offering me this trashy salad! wow!! i've been to other brazil bbq buffet. i don't want 64 dollars should worth. 
then as to the service. our empty oily plates piles up high. the server didn't come until an hour into the dinner. the sea food is cold. there are only 8-9 types of meats, not 13 kinds said on the menu, so another lie! the meat is way below average. some tasted ok, such as the lamb, but after the first serve, i needed to ask for it. they didn't come to me any more. most other meats tastes like jerky, over cooked and burned. 
when it comes to bill. i asked two other lady servers to grab our sever. from the time i asked the first lady service to the time our server finally came, 20 mins passed. i am not at all exaggerating. our group was going to leave if he doesn't come, since he has taken our gift card at the beginning.
i was so upset and disappointed for the whole experience. one guy serves meat is super nice. he went to grab the meat that we be been waiting for at least 20 mins, and was no longer served to us. that was the only guy we appreciate. one other lady who helped us twice to grab our server was pretty friendly too. services from the rest of the restaurant are terrible terrible terrible.",1,0,0.9998684931463021

TqCzrojLpbgOROKZmjjFuA,2011,"please, please, read the other reviews and think about this before you even think about setting foot in this establishment.  all the negative reviews are very true.  if you've been to another brazilian restaurant, this will be a huge huge disappointment.  to boot, it is overpriced for the food quality and variety -- think about it, if over 50% of the diners have half-off certificates, it's because they're tourists and have never eaten here.

i apologize for being so negative, i usually try to find the good in establishments but there isn't much good here.  the best part of my dining experience was my server, cynthia (she was absolutely awesome!) and the fried cod (from my seafood option).  yes, the fried fish was the best part in a brazilian restaurant.

my experience as a diner started out, on a 105-degree day, of the maitred insisting on seating me as the 2-person table at the far end of the bar (farthest away from servers too!)-- facing the mall hallway and 100 feet away from the outside doors facing the heat.  when i noticed the heat and sweated immediately, she told me that it was airconditioned (as if it was my imagination).  this was early, too, around 530 p.m. with restaurant 80% empty.  not only did the meat servers ignore me (being out of the way), but i began sweating even more (hey youre splurging for a supposedly nice meal in a nice restaurant on vacation, that aint right).  i politely asked my server if it was possible to move somewhere cooler and after much discussion with the maitred (who acted all surprised-shocked that i didnt like my table, doh), they allowed me to move inside where it was 15 degrees cooler at least.

i wish i could say that the dining experience was tremendous free there on.  i really wish.  but other than my server's attentiveness, it was god-awful.  honestly for what i ordered (the churrascaria with the surf and turf), i would have been better served by dining at a nice casino buffet like planet hollywoods for half the price (take the prime rib, carved turkey carved ham plus the middle-eastern meats and add the seafood dishes with the various salads/desserts and it's 10x better).

specific reasons why i am so negative:
1. horrible logistics -- instead of having 3d red-yellow-green wood that a customer can place on a table to indicate whether he wants servers to bring meat, this restaurant uses plastic decals (smaller than a coaster) that lay flat on the table and cant be seen by servers -- thus they breeze right by you table because they cant see that you want food.
2. poor maintenance -- they did something to the floors (extra wax???) whereby people were slipping and sliding as they walked to the salad bar or restrooms, which by the way were kinda nasty.
3. poor quality and/or prepared food -- which is the main reason
a) iced tea -- i asked for unsweetened regular iced tea and received a fruity version (which can cause dietary isues) as the original server (in the bar) didnt feel it necessary to tell me (i thought the tea was rotting or going bad based on the unexpected ""flavoring"").
b) over-seasoning to mask either the quality or preparation.  filet mignon that was tasty if you could get by the intense seasoning...after a few bites i couldn't eat it.  even the ham tasted like a salt shaker -- i mean, ham is the easiest meat to cook with a little seasoning (if at all) to be flavorful.  on the seafood option, the ahi tuna skewers were all over the place -- sometime cooked just right, sometimes chewey/overcooked, and so overseasoned it wasnt edible.  next to the ham, the next easiest (or even easier) item to not screw up is grilled pineapple -- instead, i received thin, tart, hardly grilled pineapple (the kind youd get at country buffet).  even the deep-fried bananas on the salad bar-buffet were soggy and mushy.

did i speak to management and express these concerns?  no, i figured if they work there and supervise and taste their product, they should have a clue (a manager was going through the restaurant asking patrons regarding their dining experience -- honestly i just wanted to finish and leave and be done with it).  it is what it is....a $20 meal for $50-60.  you decide...but there are so many other wonderful choices for dining in vegas.",1,0,0.9990245765129739
VYQILKOPIABr7pywdg-nmQ,2013,"we purchased a living social deal, $43 for two for the meat rodizio.  awesome deal!  the salad bar itself is alright, and most of the meats were bland.  the chicken is really good though (especially the bacon wrapped chicken).  our dirty plates and glasses were never once picked up, so by the end of our dinner, we had a pile of dirty plates and glasses on our small table.  one of the good things was that we made reservations through open table, and we were seated right away when we got there.  i think there's better brazilian restaurants in vegas.  i won't be coming back.",2,0,0.9860576755457419

i am a brazilian foodie dude from sao paulo - sp. i know what is good... i should had trusted the reviews on yelp, which rated this place kind of low and then gone to via brazil. but my gf had a groupon so that's why we tried...

go to via brazil! that's a real churrascaria that meets my standards of quality food/service in las vegas. 

for brazilians now: essa churrascaria ta de brincadeira, ja fui em churrascarias de 15 reais na zona leste de sao paulo que tinham um salad bar 20 maior e melhor, carnes frescas. nao eh isso que vc vai encontrar aqui. 

food from the rodizio is very limited. some of meats served had no salt nor flavor, some were cold, and no garlic picanha? ??? this place is a joke, it's burning the good reputation of brazilian food. sorry, but i hope the owned reads it and decide to put a decent manager there........

antonio, jesus and poncho were the men providing the meat. eric asked what specifically we wanted and he communicated to each of them exactly what we wanted, filet, medium rare no bacon...exact perfection!

having a brief conversation with shari, the asst mgr, was pleasant. she assured us that the host staff will be notified and trained to be friendlier. 

we were so rudely welcomed, (the word welcomed is not best used here), that we we both felt apologetic for asking any questions.

bzN9I1Sv0DogQya1ytpzHA,2014,"jeremy was spot on that pampas compares poorly to a real rodizio (two words: chicken hearts. [they don't have them, so don't tell me about the ""7 tradition chrruascaria meats""] what should one expect from a restaurant named for a region more associated with a different country than what it purports to be.). it was adequate, but would not have been worth the price if we'd paid full price. like many of our fellow diners, we had a voucher for one entree and (one trip to?) the salad bar, so we took the $8 up-sell to the full meats. that wasn't bad. (what is a normal tip on a meal with an artificially high price, and half self-service?)

 the salad bar wasn't overwhelming, but had a few particularly good items (grilled mushrooms, hearts of palm, tortellini.)

 there is an open-bar option: unlimited beer, wine, sangria or caiparinha for $20. that's probably a good deal if you were going to order drinks anyway and drink heavily. at their prices a 3rd drink would probably cost more.

 loss of a star (and should have been a loss of tip) when our waiter asked we wanted to drink we said 'just water.' he asked 'still or sparkling?"" i found out that is a trick question, as he brought a liter bottle of water.

 when the bill came (after a long wait trying to get the waiter's attention) there was about an $8 charge for the water. the waiter was at that point holding a pitcher of water. i asked about the charge and he said ""i asked you still or sparkling and you said 'still'""  i pointed to the pitcher of ice water he was holding and said ""what do you call that?"" and he said ""tap water.""  i said ""when we said '_just_ water' that's what we wanted, it's not sparkling."" he said he would find the manager and have it taken off.

 i'm sure the time share that gave us the voucher compensates the restaurant. we accepted the up-sell for more meat. (the limited menu, and a big plate from the salad bar, would have been sufficient.) there is no need to nickel-and-dime the tourists. (some of us argue the charge, the rest probably pay the $8 for what is indistinguishable from tap water.

they bring you skewers of meat constantly and ask if you want some. if you do, they cut you pieces off to eat. you can keep eating until you are sick if you wanted to.

jhfRC4jFVWoDW7UckAL-Xw,2007,"came here with low expectations but came out pleasantly surprised. pretty decent brazilian all-you-can-eat buffet with unlimited meats brought to your table ($36.99 pp for dinner) but don't expect as wide of a buffet selection as one of the more established brazilian bbq places like fogo de chao or texas de brazil in other cities. 

overall the meats brought to the table were pretty good:
- pork loin - excellent, perfectly cooked, delicious seasoning
- lamb - very tasty. i hate lamb, but loved this one because it tasted great and wasn't gamey. that says a lot.
- chicken - regular and spicy - very moist and tasty
- beef ribs - good but a bit fatty. ribless.
- sirloin steak - good but wished it had a bit more flavor.
- flank steak - only one i didn't like. overcooked and lacked any flavor
- filet mignon chunk wrapped in bacon - good flavor w/the bacon but the filet was overcooked
- turkey sausage - was alright
- ham and pineapple - didn't try

examples of the non-meat buffet offerings:
- smoked salmon
- some beef stew thing
- roasted potatoes
- some veggie
- salads (caesar and regular)
- bread rolls
- rice
- variety of other sides

the place is very nice and elegant inside with very friendly wait staff who came by to asked us how we were doing different times. it wasn't that crowded so service was overall attentive altho spotty at certain times. simple but effective system: you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. when you want meat to come to your table, flip to green. when you are full or want a break, turn it to red.

apparently you can get a discounted rate for this place by getting ~50% off price tickets (check out tix4tonight for $19.99 for the usual $36.99 dinner meat buffet) or free by attending one of those timeshare presentations. also there are signs in the planet hollywood casino that say mention the sign and you'll get $5 off or something like that.

bottom line: if you love meat, this place should make you pretty happy.  best deal is finding some of those discounts mentioned. don't expect this to be as good as one of the other fancy brazilian churrascaria chains you may have tried in other cities and you'll be fine.",4,1,0.0010899510396618073

we went here because my parents got a voucher for two compliments of the timeshare they own. their meal had to be upgraded to unlimited meat for $10 pp. the hostess offered my husband and i a coupon for two $34 buffets. we thought that was nice...at first.
they don't tell you that you have to buy an alcoholic beverage per person in order to activate the deal - after you buy the alcohol, you're paying roughly what you would for two dinners without the coupon.
our waiter, rigo, was ok but pretty inattentive. he didn't bother to inform us that the water they bring to the table (without asking what we'd like) is an automatic charge per person.
meat service was extremely slow. they don't bring new plates after you're done with the salad bar - they told us to go get another from the bar if we wanted one. the salad bar was extremely lacking, with wilted romaine hearts and empty slots where other items should be. their cheese rolls were very dense and dry. their mashed potatoes were the only bright spot on the salad bar.
when we finally got meat cooked a little more thoroughly (everything seems to come out medium rare) the meat was flavorless and fatty. this is obviously not top quality meat. both my dad and i pulled out large chunks of gristle while chewing (mine was almost like a valve to an organ).  
we were thoroughly underwhelmed with service and food quality. we didn't leave full, but were tired of chewing the tough meat and waiting forever for the type of meat we wanted to try. the worst part, though, was when we all got sick in the middle of the night to varying degrees. getting back on a plane the next day was not fun.",1,0,0.9997069735073004

kf7rTEY7cX47BFdRgVfr6A,2019,"i saw the bad reviews but still wanted to give this place a chance. not worth it. the concept is good. but poorly executed. either that or they're being stingy on purpose. found the groupon when looking for things to do in vegas. the food was actually good, but you do not get much of it. the bar where you get your own sides was constantly empty, they need a server to watch it so that it could be refilled in a timely manner. that pet was annoying but not the worst because even though it was inconvenient you could go up and check to see if more items were put out. the worst part was the meat selection. while being there for more than a hour and half, i only got 2 pieces of thin meat and a chicken leg. there's no reason $70 should be spent and i leave still hungry. we tried to stay a little longer to see if they would happen to come back, but the servers kept skipping our table on purpose. got 3 refills of the ""endless mimosa"" only after repeatedly asking. the service was so slow, we had to leave before dessert was brought out. feel i could have went somewhere else and actually been full for the money. the groupon is an amazing deal if they actually operated the way other steakhouses operate. this place gets a thumbs down. too many other food choices nearby to waste time here",2,0,0.998916175537701

after waiting to be seated, we waited for another 10 minutes at the table before a server stopped by to say he would be right with us, before disappearing never to be seen again. meanwhile, a new server who ""just clocked in"" showed up 10 minutes after that (by now the kids are about starved to death). she explained to us that our gift card wasn't able to cover the tax (which wasn't true in the end) and that whatever the lady said about the thanksgiving special on the phone when we called beforehand was obviously not true. having just been ditched by server #1, at this point the vibe was ""not good"". we settled for some steak burgers, and made a beeline for the door as soon as we could to get out of the noisy restaurant. we were so eager to leave (and so tired of waiting for the check) that we almost left without the credit card! 
it's a good thing we used the entire gift card, because i'd probably waste the extra balance rather than go again. word of advice: save yourself the hassle and the wait, and go to a restaurant that won't leave you with a headache and an empty wallet. 

for reference: a tucanos full churrasco and buffet is $25, and the same thing (albeit with half the buffet options) is $50 at pampas. that's what i call a bad knockoff.",2,0,0.9982483754456744

we go out every week to try a new restaurant and overall in terms of food miami's restaurants beat las vegas' hands down and we have been disappointed a lot when we dine out in vegas. so i can't say this was my favorite rodizio/brazilian steakhouse that i've ever been to but it was good enough. i would come again!",4,1,0.037595951616553935

vHwMMr5B11wsTsnnI0qMJQ,2013,"the price of pampas varies depending on what time you go and what you get.  you can order stand alone items off their cart, which i've never done before.  i've always tried their rodizio, specifically the meat rodizio.  if you order the meat rodizio, it's similar to an all-you-can eat, although it's not specified as one.  

essentially, you have unlimited access to the salad bar.  the salad bar has plenty of options including every kind of  brazilian salad under the sun, it seems.  my favorite is the artichoke heart salad.  they also have many appetizer items like cheese bread and fried bananas.  the fried bananas are definitely worth trying.  at your table, the waiters come around your table w/ cuts of meat cooked on a skewer and slice you as many pieces as you choose.  you get to sample steaks, tri-tips, bbq pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, grilled chicken pieces, and sausages.  the bbq pork is especially well marinated and tasty.  

i also love that pampas purposely serves the steak to you rare to medium rare depending on the cut.  in effect, you can't say how you want your steak done -- they just serve it to you how they think you should have it, how it should be eaten.  as a foodie, i believe steak should be eaten rare to medium rare anyway (so you can discern the quality of the cut of meat), so i'm fine w/ that.  but all you ppl who do not know how to eat steak (i.e. you request it well done), don't select the steak option when it comes around.  hahaha... sorry if i sound mean, but that's how pampas does it. 

regarding the price, i think it's significantly cheaper to have lunch there than dinner.  lunch rodizio was only ~$20 per person but dinner was nearly $50 per person.  granted, i've only had dinner at the pampas in palo alto, ca and not at this one in vegas, it is of note.  

also, they have an awesome but limited dessert bar (for lunch at least).  the flan and cheesecake are pretty amazing.",5,1,0.04061254047619178

AHicQpodqRcZ420aqI0_VA,2016,"i am glad my first and last visit here was with a groupon, because i would have been even more disappointed without the dinner date deal. 
to start with we made a reservation for two to be seated at a booth.  the hostess was pleasant.  we arrived to a full house with only a half table half booth for two on the outer perimeter of the dinning room next to a wedding party.  we saw two other parties seated next to us assigned a waiter before us so we waived the next person down to be serviced.  the waiter we were assigned was not attentive or detail oriented and apologized for forgetting about us multiple times.  in addition, we had to waive down the meat skewer servers to get food.  by the time they serviced us our side dishes were cold.  the servers that passed us were mostly for the wedding party... i recommend requesting middle dinning area seating because the servers were more attentive there and they received the meat service first.  the meat tri tip was decent, the sirloin was overcooked, the seafood plate (salmon, muscles, shell on shrimp, and halibut was cold by the time it arrived at our table.  the sides are self serve buffet style at the rear of the dinning area.  
this didn't feel like a fine dinning experience or even a great introduction to a brazilian steakhouse. the service was mediocre, the food quality did not reflect the price, and the ambiance was not romantic.  i constantly had my head on the swivel and had to work to flag people down to get fed.  this type if dining was not for me. i prefer a seamless dining experience.  we only saw our waiter 3 times total.  in the beginning and then after we spoke with the manager and again shortly thereafter to deliver and pickup the check.  
the majority of the meat delivered to our table was discarded due to being overcooked or cold upon arrival.  my date was sick after the meal and we had to end our date night early.  i will not be dining here again an would not recommend this place to anyone.  the best part was the banter with my date making light of a sh!tty first time brazilian steakhouse dining experience and oh yeah the cocktails were good.",1,0,0.9718415416362027

if you've never been here, it will seem a little strange.  servers walk around with skewers of meat and shrimp and stop by your table.  if you want some, they cut you a little.  if not, they move along.  don't worry if you miss something or if you didn't get enough, they'll be back in short order.  the last couple of times i was there, i think i had the meat rodizio thingy, which came with a trip through the salad and side item bar and all-you-can-eat meats.  

i like it.  i'll be back.  it's good casual dining for when you're (a) ridiculously hungry, and (b) don't feel like waiting in line at the spice market buffet.

tip #1:  find a coupon for this place.  otherwise, it's a little pricey.  usually, there's a girl standing out on the miracle mile handing out coupons.  you'll recognize her.  believe me.  if she's not there, you'll find a coupon in some of those books people are always trying to hand you on the strip.

the manager was very nice, obviously knew he had a lot of issues with the staff.  i believe he is just there till he finds another job.  he comped the meal for poor service, but i did offer to pay for the bottle of wine i bought.

_X-INvbbL0q5f0o60XRGdA,2014,"i've been dying to try a brazilian steakhouse for awhile so when i noticed that there was a groupon for pampas that was valid when we were going to be in vegas, i jumped on it. i purchased the lunch deal which included two all-you-can-eat meals of meat, seafood and salad bar, plus one alcoholic drink per person and one dessert to share. it ended up being a great deal!

we checked out the salad bar first and i was slightly disappointed by it. i was expecting more of a green salad bar and less of the pre-made pasta salads. the caesar salad was soggy, which seemed odd considering that the restaurant had just opened less than 30 minutes before. the standouts of the salad bar for me were the garlic mashed potatoes and chicken noodle soup, which i found helped to give me a stomach a relaxing break from all the delicious meats. 

and speaking of the meats, those steaks were amazing! both the tri-tip and the top sirloin were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! as others have mentioned, they're rather salty but i, for one, have a salty tooth so i was in heaven! i loved having the meat carved right at our table and being able to have as much as i could fit in my tiny stomach. 

unfortunately, the other meat was mainly pig-based and i don't eat pig so i skipped the ham, pork loin  and even the bacon-wrapped chicken. i tried a chicken leg but didn't care for it. besides, the steaks were too good to bother with anything else.
 
thanks to yelp, i read how amazing pampas' grilled pineapple was and i knew to request some. i think that they usually bring it by your table but after 30 minutes, we had yet to see any. we asked our waitress and she notified the kitchen to bring it out. it was so sweet and delicious and balanced the rest of our meal perfectly. 

our meal ended with a choice of one of four desserts. i'm probably an odd one out here but none of the four choices (cheesecake, chocolate cake, flan and tiramisu) appealed to me. i'm more of a pie or ice cream kind of girl. i would have chosen the chocolate cake, even though i'm not a huge chocolate fan, but my boyfriend wanted to try the flan so i let him have it. i was too stuffed from my meaty meal to have much room for dessert anyway.

the salad bar had sone good options and the cheese rolls were amazing. but that is obviously not what we were the for. so on to the important part.

when we all returned to our tables with our uninspiring plates of sides... we were ready to at least dig into some hopefully delicious meat.  5 minutes... nothing comes by.  10 minutes... nothing still.  15 minutes... wow, nothing.  i ask the server what's going on, and he says that they will be by any minute now, though i can tell he doesn't give a crap about anything.  5 more minutes we wait, now starving because the salad bar has nothing to offer... and still nothing.  at this point we discuss if we should just get up and leave.  i decide to talk to the manager and tell her the situation and that we are just going to leave, and she doesn't seem surprised or apologetic at all.  just says that's fine, we can leave.  what a complete joke.

oh and here's the kicker - they were offering ""buy one get one free"" rodizio to get you in there... but then what you get wouldn't even be worth buy one get 10 free.  beware for sure... you can literally eat anywhere else in vegas and your experience will be better.  this place won't be around much longer as it exists now.",1,0,0.998818848390486

i've spent at ""pampas"" about an hour and a half, and pretty much tried all their meat's, from over cooked top sirloin to very salty pork, even the roasted pineapple they manage to spoil somehow.  on top of that, their salad buffet is sad, i've got no other way to describe it but sad.  the vegetables looked as if they have been sitting there the whole day, and the side dishes were tasteless. i wouldn't go back there even if they would charge half price!

RO5OFVUtpFM3y2PHS8qmgA,2019,"came here todays brunch with my boyfriend and all i can say is that i was disappointed. here are the pros and cons of our visit.

staff: we had a very nice waitress and everyone who brought out food was kind as well.

wait time: we had a reservation for noon and we were seated writhing 5 mins. excellent timing. 

salad bar: way better than texas de brazil

surf n turf: my boyfriend was happy with his seafood. i don't quite like seafood so i stuck to the meats only.

rodizio: worst disappointment ever. we had heard excellent things about this restaurant but we did not see anyone bringing meat for an average of 15-25mins at a time. we told the waitress that we wanted to see more of the beef selection come around. she was very nice and put that request in for us. however, i don't think that it was okay for me to wait 2 hours to only see the beef come around 3x. this is where pampas is going to start losing business and customers. for an extra $20-30 we could have gone to texas de brazil or another churrascaria and have our plates loaded with their selections of beef. 

i understand if it was a busy day for them, but there were not that many people in the establishment for us to be waiting 2 hours for beef. no excuse.

the beef was good but very rare. won't complain about that. it was mouth watering! just wish we could've seen more come around. i understand that there were only 2 beef options for brunch but at least let me see them!!!!! lol!

honestly, as much as i enjoyed their meat (the 3x it came around) and salad bar, i will probably not come back again. i am very disappointed.

i wasn't even full when we left.. 
what's the point of lying $22 for the parade of meats when you only see the meats once almost every half hour??

i'll stick to texas de brazil. 
sorry, pampas. but you guys need to step it up!!

very long story short... we got there at 10:00 pm and there appeared to be a good crowd. we were seated and told the help ourselves to the salad bar and other items. we did and returned to our table  and found our ""ordered drinks"" had not arrived. about 10 minutes later the waiter cruised by and i stopped him and asked about our drinks and some water. he said ""right away sir"".  almost 10 minutes again he showed up with our drinks and a bottle of water.
then the really bad stuff started happening!

plenty of other people have explained how the brazilian steakhouse concept works with the servers coming around with the different meats, so i'll skip that part.

the food was good. the salad bar area was self-service and there were alot of options, mostly made up of dishes we were unfamiliar with since, i assume, they were brazilian. some of them were great and some of them we didn't care for but i don't think they were made poorly, i just don't think they all fit our tastes. no problem there though, we were trying new stuff. overall the salad bar area was good.

the different meats were good, some better than others. the fillet minion was excellent, as was their very tender ham. my wife and i both loved the grilled pineapple which didn't seem that appealing at first but it really was! some of the other steaks and meats, were good, but nothing too exciting or better than you could grill up at home.

we each ordered a drink to our table; my wife had an amaretto sour and i had a margarita on the rocks. we aren't drinks snobs by any means, but both of these drinks were undrinkable. we had drinks all over the vegas strip and downtown and we never had a bad drink except these two. i will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe the bartender was sick or the servers have to make their own drinks? my margarita tasted like cheap, overly sugary sweet and sour and it tasted like something you'd expect to get out of a punch bowl at a frat party.ha! my wife's amaretto sour probably had the same sweet and sour mix in it because it tasted very similar. again, i hate to sound like a complainer because everything else was pretty good, but the drinks wouldn't even cut it at a chili's bar & grill. we didn't say anything or complain because we figured we wouldn't get anything any better.

with the two drinks and the two meals our total was $99.90 before the $40 off coupon. all in all it was a good meal and i think if you've never been to a brazilian themed steakhouse it might be worth going, especially if you get a coupon. i probably wouldn't return, only because there are so many great places to eat in vegas, but again, we enjoyed our food and our time there.",3,0,0.895563020778771

my family came into town for a school event and had found pampas online as they were advertising a promotion for ""prom"" where large parties could dine for $25 a head. i didn't do the planning for this event so if i had i would have been a little skeptical of this amount, but that isn't the point because promotions like this should be easy for any customer to understand. my family booked a large party reservation and came from states away and wanted to eat at this restaurant as a celebration after the event. they were told after being seated that they only allowed high school students to take part in the promotion, so since everyone wasn't a high school student, they couldn't use it. now i realize this seems like something you might hear and go, ""oh, duh, prom for prom-attending students"" but i would stop you and ask, did they state that it was only for high school students in the promo (answer: no) and i would also urge you to think of other season/time/holiday-related promotions of this nature - do veterans day sales only apply to military veterans? do christmas sales only apply to christians? (answer, again, to both is 'no'). all i'm saying is, put it in clear terms so you don't have people coming from far and disappointed upon arrival. the waiter did manage to get a military discount for the check since it seemed he wanted to do something to make up for this but it wasn't even close to what the promo would have been.
the second, and to me, most annoying thing about this restaurant is their water policy.
they place water bottles on the table without saying anything besides ""water for your table"", then afterwards come and tell you ""i must tell you that we charge $1 per person for water in our restaurant, but it is bottled and filtered"". first of all - you must tell people before. tell people before. secondly, there was not another option as far as we could tell, so you literally could not get a glass of water unless you paid for it. lastly, if i charged you for an unsealed bottle of water but told you - 'oh don't worry, it's filtered' - would you not wonder why in the world am i paying for tap water served in a repeatedly used glass bottle trying to pass as bottled water? sorry, but as you can tell, i was not very pleased with this practice as i personally believe it's crooked and dirty.

the cheese bread was dry and hard, the veggies are overcooked, the pasta was tasteless. the rest of the stuff though were good like the mashed potato, mushrooms, chicken tortilla soup, plantains, and salad bar. our waiter brought us the surf plate with a small bowl of mussels (terrible), shrimps (the only thing i ate), salmon (with sweet sauce and over cooked) and 2 matchbox sized pieces of tilapia which are nice and tender. i had a feeling that they were pushing for the customers to eat plates of the surf so as not to consume much of the meat. 

so, we had our little ""sign"" card turn up green for like 12 minutes, but no meat was coming out of the kitchen. my hubby and i were literally looking at each other waiting for the meat cause we don't want to get filled up with the carbs. there was a very little choice of meats during lunch, i counted 5: picanha, sirloin, bacon-wrapped chicken, pork and sausage. i don't really mind the small selection as long as the quality is good. i only asked for the picanha and sausage because the steak was almost on the rare side, no part was at least medium, an ounce of blood was oozing from a piece of meat placed on the service plate, it was gross. the gaucho said he'll get me one that is more cooked but he never came back with the piece he promised. omg, the picanha was such a big disappointment, it was so dry, tough and lacking in flavor. the sausage was the best-tasting of them all but i still won't order that in a restaurant. i tasted my hubby's chicken and it was not good either, but at least was tender. the last thing the gauchos were serving is pineapple which is a disappointment because it's supposed to be grilled, but these were not, they were just warm and looked pale and sad.

we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before the first skewer came to our table, which was pork loin. i'm more of a beef guy and would normally pass, but i was hungry. it was very juicy depite getting one of the outer slices, but the crust made it even more enjoyable. this got my hopes up which were later shot down.
the other meats that came out were, roasted ham, sirloin, spicy chicken, pheasant, and bacon wrapped turkey. the ham tasted like it came from a store. the only thing i liked about the poultry is that they are not sliced so you know you get a fresh piece, as opposed to our ham and pineapple. (it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet.

got a groupon for this place (lunch for 2 for $28, i think?). was hesitant after reading some extremely mixed reviews but figured, why not?

we came for lunch on black friday around 1:30, without a reservation, and though the restaurant was only about half full we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before being seated.  our server, kelly?, introduced herself and seemed nice enough, but seemed to forget about us throughout the rest of the meal and our bill was all sorts of messed up! she tried to charge to charge me twice for a $10 drink (honey, i had one, it was disgusting, it took 20 minutes for you to bring it to me in the first place...and i wonder how many other 'drunk' customers you tried to pull that crap on).

additionally, there was some sort of $18 additional fee for using the groupon...wait what?! ....so in reality, it was $28 + the $18 fee the restaurant charges...oh yeah, and water (flat or sparkling) is $6 a bottle...so bare minimum, lunch actually came to $58 plus tax and tip...and believe me that did not in any way reflect the quality of the meal.

yeah, it was a 'surf & turf' all you can eat kind a thing, but eeeeeesh, gross me out! the salad bar reminded me of the kind of $10 buffet you find in one of the area discount  casino/hotels, and i would say 9 out of 10 of the cuts of meat that were brought to the table were either grossly overcooked or raw. plus, they brought around the bacon wrapped chicken, and some sort of sausage thing (read: the cheap stuff!) to the table at least 3-4 times each, but only once, in the entire hour and half, brought around picanha (steak)...and the slab they cut off for us was still bleeding.

np16A3-kk2JHBc9t-cMVtw,2012,"my first experience at a brazilian all you can eat place was pleasant. the atmosphere was fun if you sit outside or near the bar because you can hear the half hour rain storm in the miracle mile shops. speaking of where to sit, the inner area near the buffet is more crowded and lit more brightly. we preferred our spot near the bar as it was more intimate. some brazilian music would be a nice addition as it was a little quiet. 

the food was very tasty and abundant. we had an 11 year old with us and he still qualified for the child's price which was nice because he's not a big eater and the all you can eat rodizios are expensive. he got his fill of cheese rolls which were a big hit!  the buffet had yummy salads and side dishes. the rodizio we ordered came with an app. and dessert. we chose the mussels in coconut cream sauce which were very good. the tiramisu was lovely as well. 

the service was good even in our less crowded spot in the restaurant. the meat coming around on the skewers doesn't stop! the bacon covered scallops were great and the beef dishes were good too. only the lamb was pretty over cooked and flavorless. the grilled pineapple is a great touch!

we came here because of a groupon for 2. i made a reservation, and upon checking in to the restaurant, my party and i were seated within a few minutes. 

salad/side bar is decent, though i'd recommend staying away from the rice and mashed potatoes trying to steal stomach space from the steaks and meats. 

meats includes tri tip roast, pork loin, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken breast, salmon, smoked ham, mussels, shrimp, grilled pineapple, and grilled chicken thighs. our favorites were definitely the pork dishes, all seasoned and cooked very well. the beef and chicken dishes fell a bit flat: beef tended to be under seasoned, chicken was dry. aside from the mussels that were extremely overcooked, the seafood was very good. the one annoying thing was the frequency of the dishes offered to us. we probably were offered smoked ham 4 times, whereas the lamb only came around once, and portions were tiny (though the lamb was also an underseasoned, overcooked disappointment).

we arrived around 9:30p and waited briefly to be seated because they only had 2 sections that they were seating.  after about 15 minutes of waiting and no greeting from anyone, the waiter for our section greets the last table that had just been seated to take their orders.  really??  aware of our displeasure, the manager approaches and apologizes, introducing our server, marcio (the same server who was just at the previously mentioned table), ""who will take good care of you.""

after giving marcio our order for the meat rodizio, he tells us to start with the salad bar area.  (we wouldn't see marcio again for a very long time.)  there is absolutely nothing notable about on the salad bar, nothing that looks tempting, or overly fresh.  everything is just alright.  we return to our table to find the meat gaucho scene bleak.  over the next 20 minutes we would be offered 3 things: fresh pineapple, sirloin, and ham.  really??  i've been to brazilian churrascarias before and i've never seen so little action.

enter the scene jeremy, our savior, who immediately jumps into action.  he asks what meats we have tried and would like to try. we tell him that we have only had 3 things, to which he says, ""i'm gonna go make a note on the board for you, so we can get you guys a taste of everything.""  thank you sweet baby jesus!  jeremy opens the flood gates, and just like that meat starts flowing into our room.  for the rest of the night jeremy would be the only person keeping an eye on our glasses, making sure we got food and beverage refills.  thank you jeremy!

food quality is highly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from a (-3) to 4.  the first piece of picanha we tried was more dehydrated, shriveled, and overcooked than a slice of beef jerky.  once we asked for rare they did step it up and deliver a tasty piece that i would rate at a 4.  their chicken legs had no flavor, pork loin was dull.  the good: bacon wrapped turkey, picanha (after adjustment), lamb (inconsistent, but had 1 good piece), and tri-tip (shocking because i normally don't care that much for it, but very flavorful & juicy).

ok, we're donzo.  check please.  marcio!  there you are!  we were certain that he had gone home or something.  i really hope that they split tips there because our ""would be server"" gave us absolutely no face time.  

at most churrascarias the gauchos are personable and communicative.  there is a total disconnect here.  once, one of the gauchos did, to my surprise, ask us if there was anything that we would like to try.  the atmosphere is non-existent.  as we strolled to our car my boyfriend made a comment that summed it all up.  he said, ""pampas is an olive garden in the world of churrascarias.""",2,0,0.9736824145136039

al-5DtZQ-PBc4vhs1S4Vww,2010,"this was my first time experiencing a brazilian steakhouse. unfortunately, i was not blown away. while walking up to the entrance, i noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. when we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. we did. she tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. when i inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. so what? just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? i did not like her attitude at all. 

the waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. he did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled. 

we were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. the side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. there were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. the food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side. 

my boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while i ordered the seafood rodizio. they brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! the salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. i had to order at least 3 orders. i understand that maybe the gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? for $45??? that was pathetic.

upon arrival the hostess showed us to our table.  the initial service was a little slow but we expected that from the other reviews.  our waiter appeared and we gave him our 1/2 price voucher.  he told us how things work, took our drink order and told us we could help ourselves to the salad bar.

i have been to brazilian steakhouses in houston, san diego, dallas, florida and buenos aires.  this one follows the typical format.  large salad bar and then the endless parade of meats.  

standouts at the salad bar included the salmon which was spicy.  i also liked the plaintains.  

the meat was very good.  plenty of it.  servers that knew rare from well done.  lamb, steak, chicken.  a particular standout was the spicy chicken.  the serving size was very large, moist and perfectly seasoned.  diners at the table also enjoyed the turkey wrapped in bacon.  it was different and a nice change of pace from the meat.  

the staff was attentive and even brought us additional lamb when requested.  a small complaint was that the filet mignon had a slightly gamey flavor that it shouldn't have had but the picanha was on target.

also, this style of steakhouse typically uses a lot of salt on their meats and if you are not used to the flavor then it can sometimes get overwhelming.  

remember.  you do not have to have a slice of every meat or item that is brought to your table.  you can and should be selective.  

the wine list had reasonable values for a restaurant in a hotel casino.  for example, a kaiken malbec by the bottle was $35.00. house wine was $30.

 because of the 1/2 price voucher.  (total meal cost with two bottles of wine was $48 per person with tip).  only three if we had to pay full price.",4,1,0.009719038808868485

aqfOH4MX6f1MI6F-ZPxoYA,2011,"ate here on saturday with a groupon and gotta agree with lauren m. if you want good brazilian bbq just go to texas de brazil. its not that this place is bad, its just put to shame by texas de brazil. atmosphere here is more like buffet, while tdb is upscale restaurant. you could impress a date at tdb not pampas. service was about equal, but i don't ask for much at brazilian bbq, just stop by with meats frequently and don't leave me waiting when i am ready to go. both places accomplished that. 

ultimately the meat is what really differentiates the star status for these to for me. tdb just seemed fresher and better cooked. most of my meats were overcooked at pampas here. at tdb the meat guys (is that what they are called? eh i'll go with it) at least tell you if meat is cooked med. rare, med. or well done. at pampas i was left guessing with most of them seeming well done, while i am a medium rare fan. the only thing cooked proper to me was pampas's sirloin. the filet, lamb and everything else was all over cooked. also salad bar is better at tdb.

this was the first brazilian restaurant we have ever tried! the food is always very good and the flavors are always amazing!

so now that we have tried some other places we still enjoy coming to pampas, they all have their own way of making the meat and some of the salads at the buffet are different than some of the other places we have gone.

there is endless array of meat so make sure not to eat too much at the salad buffet bar.
if your a meat lover you will really enjoy this to your hearts content! there is so many different meats,  i do have to say since we ordered the seafood the manager that was on duty checked to see how we were doing more often.  i don't know if they do that or just when it is not so busy that can interact more.
either way we always have a great dinner, there are other things on the menu you can add to your dinner but seriously there is so much with the salad and the meat you do not need to order anything else except drinks and they do have a special you can add for drinks.

as for the seafood there is 4 different stuff to pick from and everything below ~

we were offered a choice of sirloin, chicken legs or salmon, along with the salad bar (which includes some hot options too). i chose the salmon and was quite disappointed when it came out looking less than fulfilling. the sauce for the salmon was very good; however, the portion size is very small and the salmon was not very tasty on its own. 

and from what i understand from a person in my party, the chicken ""legs"" (which looked more like chopped thighs or breasts) were extremely dry. in fact, she called them ""chicken pucks"" like hockey pucks. ooooh boy. given the small portion sizes of the meat, i expected that they would be cooked much better. 

the salad bar was sufficient -- enough to make a filling, colorful salad (and also have soup, pastas, mashed potatoes, etc). the sautéed kale was also good. the brazilian lemonade ($6.95) is excellent.

overall, i felt somewhat scammed eating at this place. it's very clear that they really expect you to get full from the salad bar (which in theory may be okay but felt deceptive).",2,0,0.9948307565469549

the dj however was pretty good.  the only thing we didn't like was that he played several of the same genre of song in a row.  but the salsa songs, merengue songs, and bachata he played were great!  great music.  that dj should consider playing at a place with a legitimate dance floor and better service.

the only thing that was good was the watermelon and honeydew. but we could had paid way less then $100 for that somewhere else. honestly, we could have had a better buffet line and better quality food at the rio buffet. absolutely do not recommend!

s_GH7vuJwdqEAn_PfKSh9Q,2014,"this place is alright in our book. i sure do love rodizzio style. there is quite the selection of meats being continually brought out. this is awesome b/c you are continually being served hot meats (no homo lol). my favorites are the bacon wrapped turkey, the sausage and their grilled pineapple. they also have some various steak cuts, chicken, ham, etc. the one complaint we would have is all their meats are consistently 
salty. it could just be us though b/c we tend to eat low sodium meals.

my tips would be these....
1) don't waste your $ on the seafood upgrade. for what they offer it's definitely not worth the money. i will admit the ahi was good but that's it. the one item they offered that we were looking the most forward to were the shrimp and they came out dry as eff. complete and utter let down. service here is always on point unlike texas de brazil who consistently have the worst hostesses. 
2) go to discount tix tonight and pick up your meal voucher for a fraction of the cost or keep your eyes peeled on groupon for a 2 4 1 voucher that usually includes 2 drinks to boot! lunch is until 4:30 so have a late lunch and call it an early dinner to save some $ :)

the servers bringing the meats around were inconsistent in the sense that when we sat down we were bombarded with all the options and couldn't even try them all before they got cold but then took a long time for steak to come back around again.

12/29/17

had 5:00pm reservations. got here about 4:45pm and were seated immediately. we were starving so inhaled our first round in about 20mins.  kind of disappointed in us bc we could only go 1 round! we were stuffed! 

the meat guys were a little too quick for my liking to slice and dash. a couple of times they just piled things. i don't like that, but whatever. 

waiter: i think his name was sean (we started with one guy who may have gone on break bc we ended with another guy). all the staff was extremely nice and attentive. 

shrimp: excellent 

sirloin:  absolute favorite. juicy with great flavor.

tri tip:  i thought it was a little dry. the man thought it was very good and flavorful.

pork tenderloin:  i thought it was decent. i didn't finish my piece, though. the man thought it was a little on the dry side

sausage:  crispy on the outside; juicy and flavorful on the inside

bacon-wrapped filet mignon:  i love bacon but wasn't really feeling this. the man said, ""almost anything bacon-wrapped is good!"" to each his own. ‍
lamb:  first-time trying lamb. nope. not lamb fans. 

chicken:  i didn't try it. the man said the skin was nice and crispy but dry on the inside. 

ham: didn't try

salad bar:  good variety of cheese, pasta, rice, salad, and sides.

water:  excellent! i don't like water, but this was good! nice and refreshing.

guarana soda:  first time trying and it wasn't bad. refreshing; tasted like carbonated apple juice, sooooo apple cider.  (got free with my yelp checkin)

bathroom:  disappointing! was definitely in need of some maintenance and it did not smell very nice, at all.  the man said the men's restroom was ok.

picture person! this time, though, the lady didn't get irritated when i said ""no thanks"" to buying the big pictures. she was super friendly. 

 because not all the meats met our expectation from our past experiences at other brazilian steakhouses.
overall: decent. we will eat here again, especially with a bogo! 

ok -- time to roll me out .....

** update **

12/31/17

we were invited back by arash for lunch and seated in the private room. erica was our server. first thumbs up because she was amazing!!

all the meat and seafood was served hot and fresh. 

their salad buffet was still amazing. this time, someone was constantly cleaning up and replenishing. excellent bc people can be messy at buffets. 

* bacon-wrapped chicken: yes!
* sausage: yes!
* garlic mashed potatoes: yes!
* sautéed mushrooms: yes!
* sirloin: yes! plus i mixed it with my salad = excellent steak salad!
* tilapia: yes!
* mussels: both mine and the man's first time trying - different but not bad! they were served in a tomato-based sauce so you can taste the tomato. mixed with mashed potato, they were very good.
* salmon: i am allergic to salmon but the man said yes! best salmon he's had in a long time. it is topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce which they make in-house and he said it is excellent.
* ham: yes!
* chicken: in my previous review, this chicken was on the dry side. today, omg! the chefs nailed it! super moist and the skin! yes!
* tri-tip: yes! i got an end-fatty piece = eye-rolling omg! so much flavor and tenderness.
* pork tenderloin: yes! much better flavor than last time!

so -- after all this, i had to unbutton my jeans; everything was so good, i wanted to try more! so, here it goes:

* chicken tortilla soup: good. the chicken was just a tad dry, but that can happen when it's continually heating. the flavor was on point!
* corn chowder: amazing!
* tortellini salad: yes!
* asian pasta salad: first-time trying! different taste but very good.
* italian pasta salad: yes!
* green beans: yes! 
* garbanzo beans: spicy for me (i'm a total spice lightweight), but good flavor!
* basil tomato: yes!
* basil carrots: yes!
* couscous salad: yes!
* cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake: eye-rolling omg!

bathroom: yes! the men's room was being cleaned - the women's room had a fresh clean smell and was neat and tidy; as it should be! yes!

fS43dDQzza9L_anur7Ymtg,2010,"i've been a fan of pampas in palo alto and i'm definitely a fan of the one in vegas. i wanted to try the breakfast here because i got a coupon from my hotel, but i could never wake up early enough..come on people..it's vegas! who wakes up before 11:00 am?!?!? so we slowly walked down to this restaurant. had to wait for maybe 10 minutes because at the time i didn't realize it, but there was a wedding reception going on. we got seated in the private room or maybe not so private since the entire room was made of glass. we all ordered the rodizio style because by now it's our lunch time and we were all starving. first round of food came around, then the second, then third. a total of 7 meats came around, but not all the meats were good. some of it was way overcooked. i could barely chew it, so i just left it on my plate, thus the reason i didn't give this place . the service on the other hand was spectacular. everyone even the guys who cut the meats were funny and very attentive. the service basically makes up for the food at this place. next time around, maybe just maybe i might try the breakfast.",4,0,0.6661867789652776

the worst thing is the wait time.. there was literally no meat so we ended up eating salad and refillable seafood platter. we complained and followed up where are all the meats.. the table next to us was so annoyed too. i tried pampas in palo alto,ca but didnt have this bad service. our server is awesome but the meat servers are just nowhere to be found. im glad i had a groupon and didnt pay full rate.",2,1,0.4130260882323471

YZHTqZAXNguxzGO8rnSISw,2013,"i've eaten here four times that i can remember. that's how i am starting this review. with quantity.

why's that? because that's all this place is about. all you can eat meat is all about quantity. if you want quality, you go on the other side of the strip and you eat at the steak places in the city center places. if you want a sword's worth of meat, you come here.

it's worth the time it takes to chew through it all, though i do have some cautionary advice for you, depending on your evening's plans and how often you eat multiple pounds of red meat in a single sitting. maybe consider this place on the night that you are not going to be bumping up against people for hours on end in a packed nightclub. the meat-burp-breath is not as popular as it used to be a few years ago. people are starting to move on to other fads, unfortunately.

taking a lady home? i hope you brought aromatic candles with you. your room will smell like the dumpster behind a mcdonalds by the time the sun starts beating against the blackout curtains.

five-hour flight back to the east coast? i hope the plane has a convertible roof, or you might set off the lavatory smoke detectors.

no? you've got it all under control? okay. i won't give you the last bit of advice then.

best of luck.",4,0,0.8355708671323148

as we began service we ordered drinks as it was one of the requirements of the coupon and has waters all around.  food options were okay as there were 12 options of meat along with unlimited shrimp skewers.  unfortunately the meats were all dry and very bland.  when we asked for some seasoning they failed to deliver us any side seasoning for the meats.  we continued our meal and when our check came the check stated suggested gratuity with 20% calculated but the server stated that there was an auto gratuity added to our check due to our party size.  this did not sit well as the check clearly stated suggested gratuity and not auto gratuity or service charge.  on top of that they charged us for water which was tap water.

i would not recommend this place to anyone and to beware of their false advertisements of the use of total rewards reward credits and malpractice of suggested tips.

v6jxWE6hiQman_rTmnIdhw,2009,"pampas, presumably named after the pampa region of brazil, was a perfectly acceptable choice for a pre-show meal, recommended to us by the folks at tix 4 tonight. (see the other yelp reviews to explain the discount.) having arrived more than thirty minutes late due to a logistics problem* our party was concerned that we would not have enough time to eat or worse, lose our reservation completely. upon arrival we were assured by the friendly hostesses that we could be fed and on our way in under an hour. casting furtive glances at one another, our party of five decided to take a chance and be seated.

i'm glad we did so.

our waitress, michelle, did an extraordinary job of corralling a tireless squadron of saber-rattling picanha peddlers (passadores) who were all too willing to slice you off another portion of their allotted meat assignment (rodizio). every few minutes, a wave of sizzling meat arrived tableside just begging that we claw at it with our individually administered ""meat tongs"". those looking to capitalize on the premium offerings are advised to skip the chicken and turkey wrapped bacon and double up on the pinchana, pineapple ham and brazilian sausage.

also worth mentioning was the side bar that came with the rodizio specials. highlights include the spicy black beans and sausage, the caprese (wish it had fresh basil instead of dried) and the fried bananas.

i don't recommend going for the surf and turf rodizio, however. an apparent afterthought, the strangely presented fish (platter/tile/metal sheet?) was ice cold, tasteless and uninviting. a shame really as i was totally looking forward to the bacon wrapped scallops. after making a mention of this to our server she was deeply apologetic and took it off our bill.

overall the meal was of  quality, but garners a fourth star overall because of the impeccable service we received. thanks to hostess' ability to seat us within five minute (despite completely missing our reservation) and michelle's vigilant watch over our table, we were not only able to enjoy a large meal in under an hour, but also had enough time to have dessert. i myself enjoyed rich cappuccino while a friend enjoyed the flan.

* top tip: if you're arriving here by taxi, do not tell your driver to simply drop you off at planet hollywood. doing so will result in you having to traverse a near half mile length of casino floor rooms and almost the entire stretch of miracle mile shops. instead i recommend trying to find a way to be let off closer to the end of the mall. your lady friends in heels will most assuredly be thankful.",4,0,0.9443626320017284

6DIV5g3iQa4CuoMHBb0GxA,2015,"pampas and i have had our fair share of run-ins. i've complained and complained about service, and they have ignored me and ignored me. it seems like we're playing a long game of piss me off. i've been here 5 times and every-time i have an experience that's out of this world (not in a good way).

for starters, my biggest issue with pampas is that they don't come around often enough with meats. they will send one server around maybe every 5-6 minutes. the time in between you're either just sitting there looking around or getting full off water and whatever's on the salad bar (exactly what they want you to do). just think about the small servings that they are dishing off on customer's plates. by the time they walk away, the meat is already gone. so, that's 5-6 minutes waiting for another server to come around to repeat the same process. ughh! it's so frustrating!

also, when they do come around, they bring the same meats over and over again. they have like 7 meats that they rotate the whole time. it got so bad one time, three different servers had the same meat at my table. one server even had the nerve to say, ""you don't need it, you have some already."" as if it's coming out of his pocket. i was like, ""no, i want some more, because it'll probably be 10 minutes before i see another server with something different.""

oh, back to the way the servers just carve the thinnest and smallest piece of meat possible. i don't know if they think it's going to be wasted or if they were trained to be stingy. most of the servers even get irritated if you ask for another piece. just stingy, i tell you.

now, on to something else that bothers me: me being charged for water, although we order alcoholic drinks or even no drinks at all. granted, the charge is only $1 per person, but i don't feel like i should be forced to pay for something that's just sitting on the table.

a waitress and i almost had an argument on my 2nd visit, because she had an attitude for one and didn't want to be at work, but for two, she didn't know how to explain the charge for water. she just assumed that i was just going to go with it and not voice my opinion. i know she didn't make the prices, but when you tell me that's just how it is and then walk away; i get pissed.

one may ask why i keep going back. that's a fair question. i go back because the food is delicious man lol. when they do bring it around, it's just remarkable. i love mostly everything. the flavor is always on point and it's always cooked to perfection. all except today, for some reason.

for whatever reason, the food was just off today. i had to add salt to everything. the meat was just meat, nothing more, nothing less. i found myself, spitting out steak after steak. not to mention, my dessert, the chocolate brownie, or whatever the call it. it tasted like something was missing...or they changed the recipe. it wasn't good at all.

we arrived on time for a 730 reservation, and we're told to wait another 15 minutes. no problem, sat at the bar for a while. we were finally seated 30 minutes later, and waited 10 minutes for our server. finally the floor manager took our drink order. 

the salad bar was not as good as places i've been in the past. the only item i liked were the deep fried bananas and cheese bread. some items i usually enjoy, mashed potatoes, tempura, and caesar salad all fell short.

let's start with the abysmal salad bar. other places (fogo de chao, texas de brazil) have pretty high quality goods on their bar, but not pampas. it was filled with the cheapest salad bar ingredients possible. no asparagus, no artichoke hearts, no high quality cheeses, just a bunch of junk. even the salad bar at golden corral is better! the little cheese biscuits were tasty but that's it. sure, their gimmick is that it's ""unlimited,"" but so what when there is nothing you actually want to eat!?!

the rodizio food was even worse. we had a special deal to add the ""ultimate surf and turf"" seafood option. this was a complete joke. i expected fresh shrimp on skewers but nope, we were served a teeny salad sized plate with two small pieces of salmon, a small portion of mussels and 4 (yes, four!!!) pitiful looking unshelled shrimp. that's it. the seafood was pretty bad and i have never felt so ripped off. they have the gall to charge $58.00 per person for this junk! 

the service was so awful. i realize the place was inexplicably packed on a friday night, but there were plenty of waiters around so there's really no excuse. we had to wait for water refills and even for forks! the guys bringing around the skewers weren't knowledgeable about anything they were serving. we kept asking about the sausage and he would only say ""it's sausage,"" though the menu mentions there are several different kinds being served. he had no idea what kind of meat he had either! wtf? poor staff training! 

one of my friends skipped on the all you can eat and ordered a steak a la carte from the menu. it was obvious our waiter forgot to put in his order because we had to ask four times where his missing meal was. finally it arrived with zero apologies. some weird looking guy who looked like he was an elvis impersonator at his second job appeared to be the manager but he was just standing around and never even came over to our table.

checked out this place because we had a bogo coupon... or what we thought was a bogo, as the coupon was very misleading. i have attached the type of coupon to this post for reference. the coupon makes it look like you're getting the steak & endless shrimp dinner for  ~$40+ for 2 people. however, what you are getting is a discount on the normally priced $85 meal + you must buy drinks to use the coupon. either way... i cannot imagine paying $85 per person at this restaurant!! 
 
onto our endless shrimp and steak dinner experience:

the ""endless"" shrimp i.e. 2 small plates of shrimp. we got our first small plate of about 10 cold shrimp right as we got back from our first round at the salad bar, ate that real quick. the first batch was alright, okay seasoning. however, it was never replenished/asked about refill for about 30 minutes. at that point, i had asked our server for another plate of shrimp. he said ""sure, let me take your plates, so you guys can start fresh at the salad bar... we'll have the shrimp out by the time you guys come back."" okay.. we go back to the salad bar, i asked someone to refill the cheese bread station, as there were only 2 cold, hard ones left; also had to mention that the warmer for the bread wasn't on (which they then switched back on)... welp, the fresh ones weren't any better anyway.  we come back to the table, shrimp wasn't there yet and our table had been completely cleared, including our drinks (which were not empty) and silverware. we got our silverware and drinks back (finding out later that they had charged again for the drinks that they cleared!!). we ate our salad bar pickings and began our wait for our endless shrimp and meat...

we sat there for 45 minutes, without having been served any meat, despite having our card on ""green."" in that time, we watched as a food runner dropped a piece of meat on a lady's leg; he just apologized as he quickly hurried off, leaving her husband to wipe down her leg with his napkin. at some point i asked our server again for the shrimp, he was surprised that they didn't bring it out and said he'd get them for us after taking care of our neighboring guests. he brought back the second and last plate of endless shrimp and i asked for the check. that second batch of shrimp not good, no seasoning, no flavor. we ate 2 shrimps each and didn't finish the rest.

there was no organization with how the food runners were going about the tables. they would walk through our row, straight to the back, not stopping at us or our neighboring tables (we all had the same astonished looks on our faces). some food runners would even glance down at the green card, but notice that the people were not looking at them or were chatting amongst themselves, but didn't stop to ask them if they wanted any meat -- this happened multiple times to multiple tables, including us.

in the 2 hours we were there, we were offered meat/skewers no more than 10 times, 5 of those being meats we decided to try and 2 of the rounds being of their grilled pineapple skewers.. and these offerings only occurred within the first 20 minutes of us sitting down... the rest of the time we were there, no more offerings.

during those 5 times we did get meat: when the sausage skewer came by, i got the most charred piece of sausage, runner didn't even think twice about what part of the meat i was getting, just quickly slid it onto my plate and walked off. taste-wise, the food - the very limited amount that we got to try - was very mediocre.

QjsOjA3F84ECmgEuqx7QrQ,2016,"we dined here night 1 of our vegas ces adventure. the other couple we were with are big brazilian bbq fans and they were really into it, i'm not as big of a fan and wouldn't have chosen it myself, but i was outnumbered as my husband likes these types of establishments as well. however, i did end up enjoying myself a lot more than i thought i would.

we went to tix4tonight and got a coupon that basically took off $18 a person for the all you can eat meal...so we paid $3 to get $18 off, a savings of $15 total. that made me feel better as i certainly didn't think i would eat almost $50 worth of meat, so i would definitely suggest doing this deal at tix4tonight.

all 4 of us got the all you can eat which includes a salad bar of various offerings like cheese bread rolls (omg those were really good!), garlic mushrooms, pasta salads, rice, mashed potatoes, etc. it was a nice showing and i enjoyed many of the things offered there. 

they also have ""drink specials"" where you can pay $20 for unlimited beer and wine, $25 for unlimited beer, wine, and sangria, or $30 for unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and caipirhinas. i opted for the $25 and the other 3 opted for the $30. the caipirhina gal pushes a cart around in circles just re-filling as many as she possibly can. she will mix and match any flavors you want using syrups. real caipirhinas typically used muddled fruit for flavors and not syrups, but since these were all you could drink and she needed to make a lot fast, they cheated and used syrup. this didn't detract too much, but for a caipirhina purist, it could be an issue. the service was excellent on all levels all night. we were never without drinks (which made the extra money mostly worth it), meats, or fresh plates. 

the food itself was also good. they had a pretty big choice of different meats that they come around with on skewers cutting you off as much or little as you want. almost everything we had was very good. some of the meats come out more or less cooked and you can ask for the ""part"" you want. i myself like my meat well done so i asked for some of the beef well done and they actually went back and cooked me my own plate of well-done beef....nice touch.

while i wasn't thrilled to go here originally i did enjoy myself and my meal. i would not be opposed to going back if others in my group really wanted to go. i just feel like for $35 dollars (or $48 if you pay full price) you have to eat and love a lot of meat and i'm not a huge ""steak off a stick"" person lol, but there are lots of people who are and i think if you're that kinda person, you'd love it! :-)",4,1,0.013463126371674905

Gi67wMoBMhv2vX0c8Vs2qg,2012,"this restaurant defies the theory, ""you get what you pay for...""  prices at pamapas are comparable to other brazilian churrascaria's.  to our disappointment, they didn't come close to the competition.  pampas lacks in the areas of cleanliness, service, food, and atmosphere.  i would compare it to a buffet that primarily focus on serving proteins.  don't get me wrong, they do have a decent salad bar.  but the experience and value that you receive in return for the price you pay is just poor. 

this is the only churrascaria (to my knowledge) that has both surf and turf option.  however, if you choose to go opt for the meat only.  the seafood here consisted of salmon, scallops, shrimp, and a fish that i can't recall.  none were impressive and the unnamed fish was terrible.

the highlight of our mean was the picanha.  this is the ""c"" shaped meat that brazilian churrascaria's are known for.  then again, if you can't get this right... then you don't deserve to call yourself a brazilian steakhouse.

the service here is average at best.  expect your table to pile up with plates you haven't finished.  the servers don't exchange and clean off plates / tables often so you'll be showing off the carnage of items you didn't finish to other patrons.

so would i ever return?  only if every other brazilian churrascaria goes out of business and shuts down.  in a city that is overwhelmed with ayce buffets and brazilian steakhouse options, you would be better off spending your money and time elsewhere.",2,0,0.9996352653716923

the service was very good. the waiter came by several times to check with us. i appreciated that he carried the credit card reader with him so my card was never out of my sight when we paid. the prices are what you expect on the strip - no bargains here.

now people that know me, know that i love my meat! i am very familiar with brazilian churrascaria's. i went there with a group of 8 people on friday 8/22. four people in my group had never been to a place like this and i was sharing my past experiences and what  might to expect.  

it was nothing like i explained to my friends...
we got there and were seated. we were at a round table  that was directly behind the hostess table and it was in the corner.  there was a cement banister  making it hard for two people to be comfortable and get in and out.

the waiter came by and was very pushy about getting the unlimited drinks. three of us ordered the unlimited and then we were told about the drink restrictions. whatever we went with it. 

he didn't really explain about the process to the new people that were with us. i had asked him to explain and let them know the process.  after the waiter being inconvenienced to explain the process, we were able to get up and go to the salad bar. mind you, the banister is there and just annoying.  i will say that the sweet & sour chicken was very good at the salad bar. 

for the next 45 minutes the only meats that were brought around was the pork loin, which was very good and moist and flavored well.  the next was the house meat picanha, which was very bland and no flavor.  the following was the lamb, i just don't do lamb. the last server had the pineapple! besides the sweet & sour chicken the pineapple was very good.  that is all that came around. those same ones kept rotating for 45 minutes.  i finally went up to talk to the manager and asked how many meats are in rotation. she told me there are 14.  i let her know the situation and she said she will look into it.

soon after that a female server came directly at me and again had the lamb, i said no thank you, the same server came out and then had the picanha and i didn't like it the first 4 times so i said no.  she then said . well, what meats do you want? i was like whoa! excuse me, she again said which meats do i want. i said i do not know all the meats you have and then she, in a sarcastic latina voice started to ramble and ramble the meat list.  i had to ask her to stop and i could not understand her ramblings and again she said the names and faster. i then said, why are you just asking me? there are 7 other people at this table but we all have only chosen from 4 different items.  she was irritated and i was too.  then the male bald server came directly to me again and he brought the lamb.  really? i said to him, is that al they have back there because we had not had any sausage, chicken, tri tip,  other meats.  i was really disappointed that apparently the manager pointed me out and i felt these  servers were overdoing it and still not bringing anything other than the ones we already had.

the waitress was not clear in the fine print from the travel zoo package, we made sure to ask prior to ordering to prevent any confusion in our bill at the end. we made our drink selection based on what she said which the package didn't include alcoholic drinks which in the end it didn't ( i didn't order one based on what she said) at the end, as we reviewed our voucher she was wrong and did not correct it until i called her out in her mistake. she did provide us a free cheesecake until she noticed my frustration. food two thumbs up!!! service sucked!",3,1,0.1772866929263076

7OmcO-QuSnYzGx36pQ1VGw,2008,"first meal when i arrived to lv last weekend.  i knew of the one in pa and had always wanted to try it.  i didn't even know of this location until i entered the miracle mile shops inside planet hollywood.  i was primed and ready to go on the meat-fest extravaganza.  $39 for the meat only and $50 for the meat and seafood, both of which included cold salad bar visits.  feeling adventurous, i super-sized to include the seafood, just out of curiosity.

the salad bar was ok, they had some cold and hot vegetable dishes as well as smoked salmon and salad stuff.  once the food started arriving, i made sure only to try one piece of each meat and no more.  unfortunately, when eating that much meat, i realized that it was hard to appreciate and taste them individually flavor wise.  in the interest of saving your stomach, i recommend you avoid the brazilian sausage which came out dry, the lamb which tasted a little too game-ish, and the turkey wrapped in bacon, wasn't too impressive.  the seafood consisted of scallops wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, tempura battered cod, and shrimps with a butter sauce.  the salamon was dry and the cod's flavor was masked by the deep frying.  i'd only recommend the shrimp out of all the four and better to order them as a skewer than doing the rodizio.

make sure not to order the coconaut mojito on their cocktail menu.  coconaut and mint don't go together despite what our server enthusiastic words.  i had the red wine sangria which was okay...it wasn't as fruity as i have had before in spanish tapas restaurants.

average cost per diner for dinner is $70.  i'm glad i got to try this once and this place is worth at least a try but i can't imagine coming here regularly.  but if you want to avoid not feeling nine months pregnant afterwards, i highly suggest restraint and small bites throughout the meal.",3,0,0.7059702388996837

y3C0pqaLBD2nFX1K0T7hTQ,2014,"we were lured in here from the coupons that the promoters were giving on the strip. we went there and realized there were lots of small prints we didn't look into so carefully, but however it was still worth it. then we realized lots of people were coming in with their groupon and found out that we could have even more value there so we asked to switch it midway and they had no issues. 

the salad bar was great, they had artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tortellinis, fresh mozzarella, fruit, some hot dishes and them some (i could get full just eating that).

came with unlimited shrimp which was at times were overly cooked. in fact the first batch we had was leaving a bad first impression, but we like shrimp and it kept getting better. 

the meat and the shrimp was always making it to our table. hardly ever had to wait around. the only thing i have to say is that it would be nice if i had a say in where they cut the meat. the outer parts are usually the more well done section and the inner parts were of course not. the moment we say yes they just go straight to cutting the area of their choosing. thankfully my friend like the opposite so we can just switch if we needed to.

some times some of the meats felt like it came out a way over cooked. like the chipotle chicken, i bet it would have been great had it not been so crispy. 

drinks were strong, the dessert was delicious!! service was good.

overall it was a fun experience and considering we weren't paying a a crazy amount of money we felt that the food reflected its price that we paid which was discounted. not sure if i'd actually pay full price.

there was no card given to us to flip red or green. the restaurant was empty yet the men with meat sticks were very few and far between. 

it seemed their aim was to get you one slice of something and take their time in hopes you filled up on the buffet stuff to make a profit on their outgoing expensive cuts. 

we were not told that the water cost 1.00 per glass/refill if i had known that, i would have asked for tap water.

i had to ask several times where the meat gauchos were and when they did come, it was all pork offerings, no chicken, or beef after several ""no's"" i had to specifically ask for all of their beef dishes. 

the buffet table offerings were sub-par and served as filler space i felt. 

our main server was friendly but i did not openly complain about the experience, i simply had to sit there, steam about it, and deal with it.

our server kindly asked us to leave a 5-star review, and i just can't bring myself to it... i can't do it... i'm sorry sweety, you are awesome and deserve to be at a much better place than this...

fu0p7IflARN3ljLTP2rI0g,2014,"yeah, so this is a long review... but you'll understand why.

came with a friend on a saturday afternoon.  we each had vouchers for a  lunch, just the basic meats, which was fine by me.  i love me some all you can eat anything!  and brazilian bbq?  what's not to love?

we were pretty excited when we arrived that there were lots of tables open (pretty sure we just beat the lunch rush as it was almost 1:00 when we arrived) so we thought we'd be seated immediately, if not soon.  we were told 15 minutes to wait.  why?  more than 75% of the place was free and there were more than enough employees walking around chit chatting.  several were obviously servers that were standing in the corner talking, hostesses standing at the front with menus but not seating anyone.

so we wait.  moments later, a small party comes in stating they have reservations for 1:00 for 5 people.  i overhear the hostess tell them that they had to wait 20-25 minutes for their table to be ready.  really?  what was the point of making the reservation?

1:30 rolls around and they finally seat us. (30 minutes later.) the party with reservations gets seated 15 minutes after we do in the same section that hardly had anyone seated.  sucks so far.  (for them too, i'm sure.)

as we're seated, the hostess tells us our server will be there in a moment to take our drink orders.  20 minutes later, our server walks by as he's saying ""hi, i'll be right back to take your drink order"" as his voice fades with him walking away.  we get no chance to say anything.  all we wanted was water.  come on.

i say screw it, let's start at the salad bar.  (oh yeah, none of the meat has come to our table yet, 30 minutes seated with no service?) however we see the guys walking out of the kitchen and taking it to another section of the restaurant that seems to be getting much more attention than the side we were on.)  we make it back from the salad bar, and still no water.  server arrives another 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  2 waters.  another 10 minutes and the first meat guy comes around.  2 pieces of sirloin (one for my friend, one for me, wasn't bad at all) was all get got until the next guy came around 10 minutes later.  (it took our server another 15 minutes to bring us the waters from taking the order.)

overall, we arrive before 1:00 and don't leave until about 3:50.  one glass of water (server never refilled) and 6 pcs. of meat for each of us.  averaged 15-20 minutes to get a piece of meat.

to top it off?  i had a voucher which the server insisted he knew which to take as he does it all the time with these vouchers.  now, our vouchers were attached to our bus tour vouchers.  i asked him if he was sure he had the right one.  dude gave me a look of attitude and said ""look, i do this all the time, don't worry about it.""  mistake.

i go outside where our tour bus stop is (thank you lord that is was right there) and as i try to get on, the guide tells me i have the wrong vouchers.  so i go back to the restaurant.  hostess ignores me as she stands there looking at a piece of paper.  another hostess walks up and fianlly asks if she can help me.  i let her know that the server took the wrong voucher and i couldn't get on my tour bus.  she says she'll speak with the server and check with him.  she comes back with an attitude, as if i'd accused them of something totally crazy, telling me that the server was sure he took the right one.  our server never came out and the hostess was about to just brush it off.  i asked to speak to a supervisor who finally came out.  i believe her name was heather, or something close to it.  i gave her the same details, she came back with the same answer.  the server took the right voucher.  i asked to see the voucher he took, and after rolling her eyes and sighing outloud, she said hold on and walked away.  she came out this time with the actual receipt and vouchers the server took.  low and behold!  server took the wrong voucher.  i told her the one she had was the one i needed.  she insisted still that she had the correct one.  i had to finally take a stand and get a firm with her and said ""look!"" and pointed to the print, details, etc. to prove that they took the wrong one.  when she finally realized it, she looked at me again, rolled her eyes, then still had the nerve to ask me, ""so this is the one you need?""  wtf?!?!?!  i tell her yes please, she tears off the voucher off the receipt and as i'm doing to same to give her the correct one for her records, she snatches it out of my had, doesn't say another word, and walks away.  no ""sorry for the mix up"".  no ""sorry for my attitude as well as for the attitude of my employees"".  no ""sorry you missed your tour due to our incompetence"". no ""thanks from saving us from an issue!""

just don't go here unless you wanna be ripped off and treated like crap.  especially since they love to give attitude.  i wonder if that's why their service is so bad, their management is terrible!",1,0,0.9998952722852256
WbRvE2C0wDZc2DoXCRG7KQ,2019,"this is by far one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had. 

we got the meat rodizio for dinner, which offers 13 meats and a grilled pineapple option, and unlimited trips to the salad/pasta bar. with the exception of the bacon wrapped chicken, the sausage and the ribs, (which was the last thing to arrive at our table, and was both tasty and fall off the bone tender), every single thing was either over cooked, tough or flavorless. we also didn't see all 13 of the options listed on the menu being sent around or offered.  the salad/pasta bar was basic. a few of us ordered the lobster tail for an additional $23. don't do it. skip the desserts as well. 

i'm giving these  to the staff member who heard my displeasure with how tough every meat i received was and tried his best to bring fresher, more tender food to our table. i truly appreciate his efforts. our waiter could not be bothered with regular check-ins. we had a voucher, and i'm unsure whether he thought that meant we wouldn't tip properly or what, but his level of service was about a 2.

Jm-dMpesxfSBv9iZTnxeFA,2019,"having tried several different variations of the brazilian steakhouses across the country; we were excited to try one here, in our own backyard. my wife and i are longtime residents of las vegas, and are fully aware of the many options there are here to dine. for my birthday today, my wife treated us to the lunch here. we did take advantage of the groupon discount, opting for the full blown lunch deal, which included the all you can eat meats, salad bar, seafood (shrimp and mussels), all you can drink for one hour (limited to sangrias, draft beer, and bloody marys), and one desert (cheesecake, tiaramisu, (my choice) chocolate cake, and one other, can't recall what. absolutely take advantage of groupon!  using this, our lunch was $70, plus tax and tip. without this, it would have been about $115. nice savings. 

i'll be honest; having reviewed many of the thousands of reviews about this place, many of which were very negative, i was a bit skeptical about what we were going to experience. here goes: the meats, in my wife's opinion, had too much garlic for her taste. she also felt the shrimp (served cold) were over cooked, making them tougher. me, i've never met a shrimp i didn't like. but that's just me. she did enjoy the pineapple, and the ham. the salad bar was average, with not nearly the variety we've experienced elsewhere. as far as our drinks, absolutely no issues there. taking my time, i was able to enjoy four bloody mary's, which were good. the tiaramisu was good. of course, we were unable to finish the ample serving, having had plenty to eat at that point. 

i'm glad we went for lunch, as i can only imagine how ""crowded"" the restaurant becomes for dinner. one other ""negative"" i should mention. they didn't have any of the red/green cards, used to indicate whether you're ready for more meats, or not. i was told ""we're out of those, sorry,"" which surprised us because, at that point, there really wasn't that many patrons eating, really only a few. why is that an issue? here's why:  our first ""offer"" of meat, was only a few minutes of sitting down to eat our salad. rather annoying. red card...they know not to bother. 

why then, ? the food would have been given maybe a  rating. but our server, andrea, made our entire dining experience a pleasure!!!  she was attentive, very friendly. she continually checked on us, hence the aforementioned four bloody mary's.  having mentioned it was my birthday, and the reason we were even there, she and a fellow coworker as promised, came at the end and sang happy birthday to me, with a candle in the desert to blow out. totally unnecessary, but very much appreciated!  

overall? it was ""ok.""  will we be return customers? probably not. it certainly wasn't horrible (we didn't dislike), like so many of the reviews indicated, but mainly because, there are just so many other decent places to eat in vegas! on to the next!  apologies for the long winded review, hope it helps for those deciding whether or not to eat here.  we've had worse experiences.",4,0,0.8613002881108089

KWqpX9iOhiBQPssc1VDY4g,2009,"fail!

i've been to a couple different brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that i've had.  i expect more from vegas.  perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.

atmosphere:
the restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  the bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  the restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the miracle mile shops located in planet hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.

food:
we had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and i had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  i was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  unfortunately, i was very disappointed.

as with most typical brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  the selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  this banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.

the meat i found to be very dry.  we sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  the filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.

the seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  you have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  the flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  just not phenomenal.

service:
we were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  we were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  this alone should of killed my appetite, but then again i'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  i guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?

here is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  she took forever to just take our orders.  the food then took even longer to come out.  i thought that meat would come and go until we had to ""tap out"" due to over consumption.  no it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  we specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...i'm on to your cost savings plan!

price:
we were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3pm and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  but of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  we quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.

lunch price is fair.

second, the service was great. our waiter was constantly checking on us, and refilling our drinks.

third, i ordered the surf and turf. i am more a meat person than seafood. i cannot recommend the seafood selection it was a bit dry and a bit too healthy. i recommend the meat selection, the tri-tip, and chicken was great. but what really stood out was the turkey sausage, bacon wrapped turkey, pork tenderloin. these were really, really good. it was all you can eat and i was stuffed.

the salad bar, was a bit thin but i was there for meat. so i have no complaints. i am visitng again very soon. i heard during dinner then have 12 types of meat but it was very busy and you had to make reservations. lunch was great, it was pretty empty and had no problems getting food or drinks.

taMrufE2OOGrG0J3YtBhOw,2015,"what an awful dining experience. as a brazilian, used to going to this kind of restaurant my whole life, i don't think i've ever felt so uncomfortable and disappointed seating on a dining table before. we were hungry, looking forward to the yummy recipes of brazilian cuisine and it was vegas for christ's sake! we made reservations for new years day at 10pm. got there and were seated right away. within minutes, the waiter comes to our table and takes our drink order. we had a voucher and were immediately told what we could and could not eat (no steaks or seafoods). he also said that we had 15 minutes to eat because the kitchen was closing soon (this was never said when we made the reservation for 10pm). 

when telling him that i'd like to upgrade and eat all that i wanted, he didn't know what to answer but stuck with ""you can't"". i found that odd. i was willing to pay whatever it took to eat what they offered (premium meats and seafood), so i felt disappointed with it. out of the 15 minute deadline he gave us to eat, 10 minutes went by and no meat was brought to our table (waiters were walking right by with the meat skewers to another section of the restaurant). i decided to inquire about it with the manager at the time. i explained to her that we were given 15 minutes to eat but still haven't gotten any meat at our table. she was surprised of such deadline given by our waiter, and worked on getting meat on our table. she said we could eat as much as we want, no hurry. she was nice and tried to take care of everything.

when the meat finally made it to our table (chicken thighs, breast, top sirloin, etc..), the quality was pretty bad. dry, blend, as if it had been reheated a few times. we tried a couple bites and left the rest on the plates. i went on to try all other cuts of meat, but the quality was consistent throughout. i figured i'd cancel the seafood upgrade as i expected it would be just as bad. the salad bar was good, and that was mostly what we ate (and the cheese breads, those were yummy. but i can make those at home lol). to those who don't know, the main feature of brazilian steak houses, is the constant flow of different cuts and types of meat that are brought to the tables. unfortunately, that night, we didn't enjoy that.

the service was regretful the entire night. our waiter offered to take our plates several times when we were still obviously working on it. he seemed untrained and not too professional. he even took a bite (with his hands) from something in the salad bar as he was walking away from us. probably thought no one would see it. lol then wandered around the restaurant chewing what he ate. he also made a plate for himself in the middle of service. haha.

we wondered if that was just a regular evening of service there, or if it was just due to us having a voucher. we will never know because we are never  going back. lol if we knew that one of our vacation dinner experiences would be so miserable, we would have definitely chosen somewhere else to eat, with voucher or not. after all, the best restaurants in the world are in vegas. and apparently, the worst.",1,0,0.9968759335953493

i am a meat lover, so brazilian grills are one of my favorites. i have been to a few locations around us and canada but never had i gone to one that i left 80% of the meat on my plate. the first round come a cheese crusted filet, that is cooked 120%. i feel bad coz of it was cooked properly at medium rare or even medium, i would think the beef would be a nice cut. but what we got was a super dried up chunk that is hard to swallow. next up was a burnt, hard piece of ham that once i saw i refused. then the server brought over this bacon wrapped chicken breast that the bacon is crispy but the chick is dry and hard. we were ready to call it off but the next meat coming up was a perfect medium rare sirloin tip that sort of saved the day - well it's heaven compare to the last three! even the seasoning is non-existent. and the sirloin roast that came after was decent even it's cooked to medium well. then there is a pork loin that turns out to be the best one. i asked if i can get some lamb to end the meal, and when the server brought out the skewer i cannot believe my eyes. they were like lamb jerky, tough and dried with absolutely no juice or moisture on the meat. the dude wanna drop me a big piece and i asked him to only give me 1/4 of the piece and i cannot even swallow a single bite. 
i told the server, who is very very kind and courteous, that their meat is way over cooked and i cannot eat it. and he just replied ""well that's the good thing about here, you don't have to finish it if you don't like it.""  sure but i still feel bad that food is wasted, and i still have to pay for it too!  so,  is for their service. from the hostess at the door to our waiter, they are really great people. the other  is for their salad bar, which is much better tasting than their meats. minus  for their main attraction. and also no star for their grilled cheese that my kid ordered, which is strangely two bottom half of a hot dog bun barely toasted with half melted cheese. yeah, they even screwed up a grilled cheese!
they charge $54.95 for an adult. we were recommended by our hotel to go there and we were given a 50% off coupon, which ended up only paying $65 before tips in total for three ($27.5 for each adult, $3 for the grilled cheese, plus 0.50 each for water. yes. they charge $1 per person for water!!) if i had to pay full price for this meal, i will probably raise hell. 
final verdict - avoid at all cost. go elsewhere if you want good meat. it is sad to see a restaurant that would destroy food like this.",1,0,0.9994298371261395

UHNwA7AlCOlaxyi-WQkYuw,2009,"first off, i want to say this place is pretty pricey.  i've heard that the rodizzio (sp?) is the most recommended.  it's about $46 for all you can eat meats + a fesh bar/buffet with lots of greens, veggies and a few sides such as potatoes and rice.

i decided to order the chicken dinner entree. i paid $38 for this plate. it came with a lot of chicken which was so dry. i couldn't eat it all.  it also came with squash and zucchini which i ate and was tasty and a side of mashed potatoes which was also fine.  

my boyfriend got the rodezzio(sp) which was all you can eat meat.  the servers came around a lot with the meats but i think it was because they were trying to get rid of it all before closing.

we also got our picture taken by a lady who snaps your photo.  you get your picture on a free post card and she also comes out with your photos in a paper frame in case you want to purchase them for $15. 

anyway, for 2 people, 2 soft drinks, a dry chicken plate and all you can eat meat, + tip came out to give or take $90.
the meats were very very flavorful and so juicy! i loved it!

if you want to spend the money, fine. just make sure you're very hungry and stick with the meats (don't get the chicken)

-K5qREB2RE2GtI68hKCGlQ,2014,"probably the worst brazilian steakhouse i've been to. it is so bad that they need to hand out coupons and advertise for people to eat here. really? i almost equate this place to a poor man's churrascaria lol. service here is mediocre and the food comes out very slow compared to the competition, where food seems to flow out and is carved at tables non-stop. i've only been here a couple times in the last 4 years and it's only usually when i get a comped meal, gift card or coupon. if you don't have any of those then it's not worth it because after visiting the salad bar you'll be waiting all night for the meats to come by. and when one comes, you'll be waiting forever again for the next guy to stop by.

the food itself is ok. i'm not a big salad bar person at these types of places because everything is premade and they usually don't have any regular salads or sides. the quality of the meats are hit or miss because sometimes they are too overcooked. i guess if you like your steaks well done then you won't mind. the meats that aren't overcooked are sometimes too salty which makes them hard to eat as well. i also hate that they don't bring you any fresh sides with your meal because everything is up at the salad bar.

the good news is they have happy hour so if you like wine this may be a good spot to check out since all their glasses of wine are $5, i believe, during happy hour. don't see myself coming back in the near future. i think i'll stick with my favorite churrascaria, texas de brazil.",2,0,0.9816728757902161

hsRQN5wkmtdAvZOROFcWcw,2008,"a carnivore's nightmare!

perhaps my tastebuds have gotten picky as i've gotten older, but this place was a downer.  i wasn't expecting imported steak or aged meats, but for a brazilian churrascaria, i'd like some flavor (if you meats don't cut it) please.

we came here the day prior to ash wednesday.  for all of you non-catholics, you may be more familiar with other terms this day goes by, like ""fat tuesday and mardi gras"" or ""carnival.""  so, prior to our 40-days of abstinence, we were expecting a real meal.

this place did not deliver.  even with the 40% discount that http://www.tix4tonight.com/ provided, $22 for all-you-can-eat (discounted from $36) plus $15 average drinks is not a deal at all.  

nope, i'm not kidding about $15 cocktails.  and, nope, it's not in a bigger glass.  it comes in your regular, everyday lowball.  i've clubbed in vegas, la, nyc, london, etc., $15 is a  total rip-off.  i would have been better off sitting on a slot machine on the casino floor with my $15 (and served a free double shot of whiskey and d.coke) and had a better time.  and, to add to the hysteria, if you opt for wine, they give you this big silly, plastic wine bottle to order off of.

as we all know, every true churrascaria will pass on the chicken and all the other filler crap that they try to feed you in the beginning.  so, i could not honestly critique those items.  however, all the (should have been) good stuff (i.e. beef and lamb) was medium to done because of all the re-cooking.  this was not at all pleasing to me, as i prefer medium-rare for these meats.  the petite fillet was fair, in flavoring and in seasoning.  however, the lamb was not fresh and you could taste it.  the pork was on the dry side.  and, i could have used a little more blood on my ribeye.

with that, i couldn't begin to imagine paying full price.  but if you must experience it, check out tix4tonight.com before you go.  the closest one to the restaurant is at the hawaiian marketplace, in front of polo towers.",1,1,0.15669793513363472

the high proportion of pork products was also welcome, as it was vegas and i was incredibly hungover.  if you didn't know salty fatty meats are the best thing for a hangover (besides a bloody mary) you're welcome!

tri tip - also a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless
sausage - yumm
bacon-wrapped turkey - more please!

aKWj-_lHqKQiwkn2VAaDoQ,2016,"i think that people who have never been to this particular brazilian/argentinian-style restaurant seem intrigued by the presentation, and relatively satisfied.  however, there are a lot more thumbs-down reviews of this place, and having been to many churrascarias, this is among the worst...largely due to the food, but partly due to their latest marketing strategies to pick your pocket.

the full name of this place is ""pampas brazilian grille"" and you'll find it squirreled away in a remote corner of the ""miracle mile"" shops inside the planet hollywood complex adjacent to a nondescript door on harmon avenue.  they are prevalent with many of the online discounters, so we chose (and you should too!) to purchase a voucher on travelzoo, dinner for four ($94 - $10 code i found online) = $84.  that also includes one bottle of ""house wine,"" or they'll give you $32 against any other wine they carry. we passed once we looked at the overpriced wine listed.  still sounds like a great deal though, huh?

of course, the waiter is all about upselling you from your low-priced voucher the minute you sit down, so be sure to get your friendly-but-firm face on to defer his suggestions.  the salad bar here is very ordinary--in fact, not even as good as a decent las vegas hotel buffet--and certainly pales in comparison to other churrascarias in town.  most of these places are known for the astounding arrays in their salad bars, and you literally have to be careful not to fill up on all that, so you'll have room for the more expensive main course: meat!

their meat:  regrettably, we were served uniformly poor cuts of almost everything they offer.  when's the last time you had ""filet mignon"" (if that's what it really was) that was full of gristle, hard to cut and worse to chew? so disappointing, and disgusting!  the series of other beef cuts were equally awful, either due to lack of seasoning or poor cooking (either way overcooked or raw inside), with the exception of their ""house special""--a top sirloin cooked about right with an appealing outer seasoning.  the bacon-wrapped chicken breast was also edible, but so what--it's just chicken.  i ended up filling up mostly on salad and mashed potatoes when i sasw where this was going.  a member of our party had to ask a couple of times for lamb (i passed), but said it was definitely not worth the wait.  i had lamb once at texas de brasil (another terrible churrascaria restaurant in vegas) that was so gamey/nasty, i literally ran to the bathroom to vomit. i swore to myself: never again.

anyway, at $22 per person (before the extra charges and tip), i guess we got about what we would expect, but really didn't consider it a great value (or a very good meal), and certainly glad we didn't pay more than we did.  when the waiter brought the check, it included sales tax (about $6, not included with the voucher) and a ""water conservation fee"" of $1 per person (?) = $4. no explanation on that one (seems like another bs charge to me), considering that they are just serving tap water in some weird decanter.  is this a city/county mandated fee that goes into conserving water there?

our not-very-personable, mostly inattentive waiter then proceeds to point out that if we had paid full price, the bill would be ~$230, and the suggested tip would be 20% = ~$45!!  he wanted to stand right there in front of me while i filled out that tip amount to be included on my credit card charge.  good luck with that strategy, my friend.  i told him to bring me the charge slip just for the tax and ""water conservation"" fee.  i left a $30 cash tip, concluding that was more than generous for the very minimal amount of time he and his meat-serving, deadbrained buddies spent on us (don't bother to ask those clowns for anything...they'll say no problem and that's the end of that).  

bottom line: bad food, tourist trap...steer clear, mateys!",1,0,0.9999705809615898

our groupon had dessert included and it too was awful. we ordered tiramisu as it is a favorite and it literally tasted like water i didn't even want it. never never again will we return or recommend. being las vegas there are tons of places to eat that are less expensive and have much much better food. if you like good food don't go here because you won't find it.

you may think this place is good because of the good reviews but you will be shocked. they are good reviews because they will give you a free dessert for writing a review and showing it to them at the table. the people who do that are not going to be honest when they have to show it to the server . . . think about it.",1,0,0.999991540766266

alysia drove her own personal vehicle out to where we were shooting and delivered our lunch to us.  we ordered an assortment of box lunches, box salads and soups.  i have had my share of box lunches while working on location and pampas box lunches were by far the best i have had.  they were fresh and delicious, and the condiments all came on the side (including lettuce and tomato) 

the crew couldn't have been happier.  

we made sure to get our order in that day for the following shoot day and new location which was the valley of fire.  again, alysia drove her car out to meet us in the middle of the desert,  and delivered our lunch.  

when the crew broke, people were literally running to the table to make sure and get  soup that day. 

again we couldn't have been happier.  

they were dependable and the fact that i just worked with one person the whole time really made me feel like she was taking care of us.

good atmosphere in a group of 8, the only reason they didn't get  from me is 2 fold:  first, the group on was limited to 1 per table and our group all wanted to sit together (they have to realize most parties travel is bigger groups and if we're going out to eat, we want to sit together)... now, they did end up letting us all sit together, but that led to the 2nd 'issue', which was they tried to give us one bill at the end of the night w/ gratuity charged to the retail value of the meal(s) (not the group on prices), not based on our invidual meal receipts.... 

now, after brining up the issue, they did split our bills according, but the gratuity was still being charged based off the full retail price of the surf and turf dinner...

this place was such a scam and was without a doubt the most unpleasant dining experience i've ever had.
there was a guy outside handing out $15 off coupons for the buffet option, and although i didn't want the buffet, the man told us i could order something a la carte and that i'd be able to share with my boyfriend if he did the buffet option, so we agreed to give it a shot. 
after the waiter had seated us, he then proceeds to tell my boyfriend that in order to activate the coupon, he needs to order a cocktail first....then he tells us that there's an additional charge for water!!
halfway through our meal, our waiter comes by and yells at us because i was eating a few spoonfuls of mashed potatoes off of my boyfriend's plate, and threatens to charge us for an additional buffet fee since i was not allowed to do this (even though he neglected to mention this when we sat down; and we had even specifically mentioned to him that we had never been to a brazilian steakhouse buffet before). 
after making a scene in front of everyone sitting near us, the waiter hesitantly agreed not to charge extra for the additional buffet fee after we asked to speak with the manager...
we had both pretty much lost our appetites at this point and asked for the check (which the waiter makes you pay for right in front of him so he can see how much you're tipping, which in turn made things pretty awkward for us after such a terrible experience).

.::overall::.

seafood dinner (includes: shrimp, bacon wrap scallops, battered fish and grilled salmon) - shrimp - good - scallops - ok (bacon was chewy) - battered fish - good - grilled salmon - bad (very dry no flavor) 

lamb - good

filet mignon in parmesan cheese - not so good (over cooked in my taste)

smoked salmon w/capers - very good

pasta salad - very good

tomato/mozzarella & basil - very good

tT5LO50bZyTO2w-gL0QoNg,2016,"i'm writing this review as i eat this very sad dinner in the middle of pampas :(

very tough, dry meat :( every single piece of meat -- chicken wrapped in bacon, pork loin, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, tritip, pork sausage, etc -- is just plain dry. even the chicken in the tortilla soup is somehow dry! i can't concentrate on anything else. 

the salad bar is pretty lacking, too. the hot choices are lukewarm in temperature and taste. the pasta of the day was penne with slices of squash, but i have no idea what the sauce was or if there was one. i do like the cheese bread, but they'd be so much better served hot instead of wasting away in a buffet tray.

pampas does seem pretty tech-savvy, which is nice. i like how you can make reservations directly through yelp. you can get a free dessert if you write a review with a picture, and pokemon go players can get a free bottle of wine if they check in through yelp and put a lure module on the nearest pokestop. i can't reach the pokestop from where they seated us, though, so we had to skip that. 

also, all of the gauchos keep reaching over the table to give each of us pieces of meat, sticking their swords and knives in our faces in the process. your arms aren't that long, dude. walk around the table.

all the beef cuts tasted exactly the same, bland and no flavour at all.
there was very little selection at the buffet and the food again tasted horrible. pasta was hard and they even ran out of fresh clean plates and we had to stand to wait for more.
the waiter never took away dirty dishes, ours was full of unwanted fatty bad meat.
but the worse part is the con they tell you is a deal with the 1/2 price coupons they are pushing out inside the mall and casino.
look on their web site, a meat dinner is $54.95. so here we are expecting that the bill to be $54.95 + 1 beer that i had. they charge you $1.00 each for the water they serve you too. nope, our bill was $93 and change. the waiter said it was normally $184 for 2. the coupon gives you 1/2 off.

the sirloin tri-tip was so tough and completely devoid of any flavor.  the house sirloin looked promising but failed in every way - very tough, very chewy and very bland.  i quickly gave up after a few samples of meats and cut my losses and paid the check.

ECRKhONN1HLd6O4v5Iw9Tg,2016,"main course was okay. glad i didn't pay full price (30 bucks a plate) but i did pay for a food voucher with our tickets and received so so service. i felt that because we had a ""voucher"" that we got service like we were just getting free food. we waited to be seated for 10 mins when the restaurant was half empty, waited another 6 to 10 after being seated and then took forever to get our reciept to leave. 

 i would say that the food lacked flavoring, like salt. i had to add that to my steak just to get a little more taste. the ""fresh"" green beans were a little overcooked for my taking, but the side bar was great. they charge a 2 dollar convenience fee for water but dont tell you until your bill arrives. 

the bar environment was upbeat and the restaurant side was a nice place to relax. i only saw our server once though. kind of felt like a free for all, they give you water on the table and leave you be. after dinner our server brought over our reciept and showed us what our bill ""would have been"" if we paid and showed us what we could tip based off the prices we could have been paying. that was a little annoying because we did pay for the food voucher and i felt she didn't deserve a tip, because we only saw her when we were sat and when she cleared our table. sorry, not leaving a 9 dollar tip when you didn't do anything. we are good tippers when the people treat you equal and do an amazing job.

my husband and i felt that the ""voucher"" food was staged already. one, the food came out in like 10 min, the steaks seemed kind of rubbery, the green beans seemed like the sat in boiling water for too long and the mashed potatoes tasted differently from the food bar was serving. word of advice...fill up on the side bar it's the best (and most) seasoned thing of the night.

9ZXhJoakk3kPhan-uxx5gg,2013,"if i could give this place a negative digit rating, i would. it seems like everyone only goes to this place cause they have coupons, which a lot of people agreed was a false advertisement and wasn't worth it. if you dont want to read my long dragged out story about my experience at this restaurant, i'll tell it to you straight. this place is a joke. money hungry jerks wanting to rip you off, and the food and service is terrible. definitely not worth the money. i have lived in las vegas my whole life and have ate at some very prestigious and fantastic restaurants. this was definitely not one, even if it was much cheaper than it is. point plank, avoid at all costs. 

ok, let my story of this miserable meal begin. i admit i have never eaten at a restaurant with this type of menu or set up. sort of a buffet, but much more complicated. i was with my good friend, we decided to go to miracle mile to do a bit of shopping. once we found what we wanted, we decided we wanted to eat. he had eaten at a brazilian grill similar to this in rio, brazil. he said he liked it when he had it, and all i really wanted was a lobster tail. we went in, got a table, and our waiter came over, i think i recall his name being eric. 
he started explaining the menu to us. i didn't completely comprehend because all i really wanted was lobster with was $17 all la cart. pretty much you can get the unlimited salad bar for $25/person and add meat for an extra amount. neither of us added the meat, so i don't know what it would have came out to. i just got the lobster, i wasn't that hungry and thought i would have been fine. my friend just did the salad bar for $25, no meat included. so no one came around to us with the skewers of food, so i can't comment on the quality of the meat. so first with the salad bar, it's about the size of kitchen island counter. nothing really great, some lettuce, veggies, antipasti, and soup. definitely not worth the $25. 
so we ordered, and my friend got right up and went to get some food. i stayed at the table, hoping my lobster would show up soon. my friend came back with a plate full of very low quality food. right then i remembered my medication, that i need to take with food. no big deal, i picked up my fork and grabbed two small fork fulls of caesar salad off his plate. right as i took the second bite, which was all i planned on taking just to get my medication in me, the waiter came over and very rudely said, ""mam, you can't eat off his plate, i have to charge you the $25."" for two bites??!! ok, first, i am a 5' 3"", 100lbs, 21 year old woman, it wasn't like i mauled his plate, or got up and grabbed my own plate. i freaked. i understand people try to pull stuff like that all the time, but he literally watched me pick up my fork, take two bites, and put my fork back down. what he should have said was ""mam, if you want food from the var, i have to charge you $25. if not you can please put your fork down."" nope. he just said charging you $25 and walked away. i was very angry, mumbling cuss words under my breath. my friend was going to pay, and i wasn't going to allow him to pay for it when i didn't need or use the bar.
 then my lobster came, just the tail, a cup of butter, and a lemon wedge. i cut it up, and looked at my plate. i couldn't believe it, i literally took three bites and the food was gone. the taste was good, but the portion was ridiculous, especially for $17. when i was done, i was heated. my friend flagged down the waiter and asked him if he was seriously going to charge me for the two bites and why he couldnt have pretended he didnt see it. the waiter went off, ""sir, this is my job. i could loose my job over that."" blah blah blah. while i was thinking, who are you? why the hell should i care about your job? i care about getting ripped off, not your problems. that's when we told him to bring over the manager. he said ok and went to go get him. he came back and simply said, ""he took the $25 off your bill"", and stormed away. even the manger knew the whole thing was ridiculous. needless to say eric didn't get a tip.
moral of the story? this place is a joke. food portion and salad bar quality is a joke. ridiculous prices for not so great food or service. i am very angry with this resurant and i will definitely never go back, let alone acknowledge that it even exists. avoid this place unless you want to be broke and left hungry and dissatisfied.",1,0,0.9999488320657566

we did have a voucher from our resort to check it out. i had a reservation and was able to get a table quickly, however it was on the ""patio"". the patio consisted of tables on the outside of the building, it's an indoor building so people are just standing around. we opted to sit at the bar top in hopes to get faster service and less stares from people walking by. 

we waited 20 minutes before even seeing any meat come around. once it started the first round was good. then it went down hill from there. i like a medium rare steak, but when the entire steak/meat has nothing but red blood spilling from it... that's a good indication it's not cooked. honestly feel like this place is just a major tourist attraction that resorts get tons of coupons for and give out. this is their main business and they aren't looking to impress you. 

don't be fooled by the upscale pricing, the ""unlimited"" hot and cold car and the fun atmosphere video provided online. the pricing is a rip off considering you walk away hungry. the unlimited hot and cold bar had veggie salads that appeared to be sitting out for hours, you could see the kitchen wide open from the bar and the only american food besides salad was mashed potatoes.",1,0,0.9968014295686435

for one, our waiter was whack. my mum and brother had never done rodizio before, so they weren't sure what was going on. but at least they had bf and myself to explain. any other noobs would've been completely lost. cos not only were we seated for a pretty long time before our waiter came, when he finally did make it around to us, he did a poor job of explaining everything. keep in mind this is morning time, with just one other table occupied besides ours. i couldn't help but watch this guy do nonsense stuff while we were just left hanging. time after time again. i'm a lot more keen on waiter-behavior now, after doing my own time waiting tables.

the meat servers were...okay. they were definitely nice enough. but they just didn't have skills. remember when i talked about texas de brazil meat servers looking unhappy? well happy or not, i didn't get to appreciate their skills at cutting meat until seeing pampas guys cutting meat. watching these guys was so, so awkward. they were going for thin slices but then were only able to cut so much at the width they were cutting... it just seemed like such a process, whereas at texas, voila--big chunka meat. the tables are also kinda small, so the servers would kind of have to cram in at the corners, and we were asked to move things around for them a few times.... awkward.

the food itself was blah. it reminded me of what you might find at a cheap hotel's complimentary breakfast. you can def find better breakfast food at any other breakfast buffet in town. and what's up with that top glass that goes so far out, you have to crouch, stick your head in, and reach for inner items? awkward. the breakfast meats included picanha, or 'beef' as we were told, ham, breakfast sausage, and some other sausage, ranging from substandard to standard. the best thing was definitely the grilled pineapple. although the first time it came around, it was just normal pineapple. but the second time it came around, it was fresh off the grill, and that was absolutely delicious. it was the one and only good part of this whole experience. oh, wait. $3 mimosas aren't bad either.

but to top off the bad, i'm pretty sure they overcharged us. and it sucks cos my mum is one of those who just hands over her credit card without looking at the check. i wonder how we're so deep in debt.... i even got reprimanded for being so stingy/skeptical when i mentioned something about the total being more than expected. hey, i just like to know where my money's going. so i think it might've been that they didn't have a button or whatever to calculate this coupon we had, and they ended up just charging us the full price ($12.95) for three people instead of the $6.50 for four people. that's a difference of $12.85. i blame that waiter of ours. bastard.",1,0,0.7010121894000918

there is a little buffet that accompanies the meats carved tableside. there are nice breakfast items like french toast, eggs, cheese omelets, breakfast potatoes, breads, etc. there are also other items like vegetables, salads, rice, beans, hearts of palms and so on. there is something for everyone!

the meats carved tableside are very good. the sirloin is always a favorite as well as the chicken drumstick. two types of sausages make the round, both pork and chicken, as well as a delicious ham. it is not as big of a selection as during lunch or dinner time but for breakfast and for the price... i am not complaining.

as for the booze part, you can add one hour for $15 of all you can drink mimosas or bloody mary's. i normally choose the mimosas, actually the cranberry mimosa! i like to say that it is filtering my kidneys while the champagne passes through it. ;) they do serve a regular oj mimosa so you can always ask what juices they have for the day to make your mimosa.

i was really looking forward to trying the lamb and was a bit disappointed it wasn't the burst of flavor(i was expecting) it was rubbery and tasteless. 
did they have to put bacon on the chicken?!!! so sad...i was like ""no!"" 

 i really hope they start marinating the meats more and perhaps let it rest for a longer period of time for the meat to observe the flavors of the seasoning.

i like the fact that they do offer photography services....just incase you have great company but remember for 2 pics i paid $30. so take it easy (don't turn it into a photo shoot!) lol 
why not?! give the place a try, perhaps you'll have a better experience and of course we all have different tastebuds...;)",3,1,0.48297666382413285
I7cdNlm6ad_qrG1zuGfSzw,2016,"had one of the worst experiences eating here during my stay in las vegas. i don't know about the ayce, but stay away from the ala carte menu.

1. food: way too salty to eat, way too tough to chew, and on top of that, the food came out cold. it was most definitely the worst steak i've had in my life. 

2. service: slow, unfriendly, & inefficient. 

we talked to our server about the cold plates of food we had received. he didn't seem to care and didn't apologize once. he took our plates back without telling us what was going on, and we waited another 10-15 mins for the food to come back out. in the mean time, we asked to speak to the manager bc the service was so poor. but the manager was no where to be found. when the food came back out, it was cold again, and this time the steaks were over cooked. when the waiter came by and asked how it was the second time, we stated that it was not any better. he just said okay and walked away. in the end, we just ate the steaks, but i couldn't finish mine because it was way too salty to eat. finally, we were able to speak to the manager, but he wasn't any better. it made sense why the service was so horrible, because the manager, himself, was not up to par.",1,0,0.9999927734824198

my family and i came to have lunch at this place only to be sat down for 15mins before anyone even came over to acknowledge us. before anyone approached us, my mom asked another worker if she can speak to the manager.. do you think a manager came over? absolutely not! so finally a server came over by the name of erica, super rude server.told us that no one can share food or let anyone at our table eat some of our food. excuse me, that is ridiculous!! she also had another server (joanna) watching us to make sure no one was sharing. it was a very uncomfortable experience eating here and i wish we would have went to a different steak house.  we had a few free vouches to this place and maybe that's why we were treated the way we were but you never know who is around you. everyone didn't use vouchers, we have money & it shows that people will treat you different and not have any idea who you and your family are .they bring over water in these glass bottles and you can definitely taste that it is tap water... yuck..plus we didn't even ask for water she just brought it over, only to find out it's $5 smh, at least ask people if they want water and don't forget to tell them it's $5 and also tap water . my sister paid for unlimited shrimp and asked for a togo box and the other server (joanna)that erica had watching us told my sister "" i have to see if you can take that togo"". finally our sever comes over and brings a togo box and bag the states that she's not suppose to do this but will. mind you, they did for other tables that had unlimited meat etc.. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. do not waste your time. food was okay but you'll be better off going somewhere else. it took so long just for us to receive our check so we can go on with our day. the manager marjorie then comes over ( we've asked for her well over an hour ago) all she can say was she apologizes and she waived the rest of our check. who wants to receive this type of service while out of town? please do better on staffing and customer service. we will never return to this place and i advise you to not step foot in here.",1,0,0.9999247440914499

whatever the specialty meat was and the sausage, were by far the stars of the meal along with the mojitos.  the rest of the meat was meh.  the plate of seafood was terrible and not even worth eating.  the salad bar had a great selection, but we stuffed ourselves so full of meat that we barely ate anything from the salad bar.  

the mojito was really good.  we tried another rum based drink but ended up getting a second round of mojitos because they were delicious.

we really enjoy brazilian steakhouses and have been lucky to visit them occasionally for about twenty years.

we enjoyed the food.  i always love the syrup coated plantains and salad bar.  the salad bar here had less variety than i was used to, but had some solid favorites.  the fresh fruit and veggies were good.  i like the mashed potatoes.  not many prepared salads but the chick pea salad was good.  a bit of overkill on the cold pasta in my opinion.

the meat was good and the meat servers were super friendly.  we didn't see them too often but i think it may have been our table  location.... we were kind of out of the way in a nook near the front entrance.

we never did get our seafood platter.  we're still waiting.  is it ready yet?

we gave that up for lost and did end up ordering dessert.  that was the best part of the experience.  the mousse and flan were great!

we had one waiter take our order and then never saw him again.  another one sort of took over i guess, and he was nice enough... but no one person seemed to be really monitoring our table.

the food was amazing, i will give them that.  the meat was well seasoned, the salad bar had all of the favorites..   and that was the good part.

we were told, upon purchasing our ""half price ticket"" for the lunch at pampas, that this experience was a virtual ""meat parade.""  no really, look it up.  every add, every person affiliated with it will claim that it is a meat parade, the idea that people bring various meats to your table as you eat.  however, after 15 mins of waiting, our parade had not even started.  and then, when it did start, the meats were so few and far between, and the serving sizes so small that when i showed the manager the size of my slice of fillet, he laughed in embarassment.
after my complaint, the meat parade really picked up.  we were offered meat every couple of minutes, but by that time we had already stuffed ourselves with the salad bar as we were so damn hungry, which is why we thought it appropriate to have a meat parade at all.

the manager did give us a free dessert due to poor service (cheesecake.. not impressed..) but it was disapointing overall.  too bad, too, because it wasn't cheap.

also, the entire coke machine was broken and the cokes were flat.  however, after they fixed it, they never brought us one, even though the people in the table behind us did get one.  which brings us to this: our server sucked.

just an fyi.. the ladies behind us felt shafted in the meat parade as well and also later complained to the manager.

bottom line:  not a meat parade, just a sald bar with a side of meat.",3,0,0.9742972837575925

highlights & low-lights:

*the ""gauchos"" don't come around as much as i'd  like. i guess its because not everyone does the all you can eat.

the first impression upon checking in for our reservation-utter confusion.  i'm not quite sure what was wrong with their reservation system, but it was definitely not working properly or it just sucked.  it seemed that there was some confusion of who to seat first, the folks that were on the walk-in waiting list or the folks that had booked a reservation.  my husband and i had a reservation, but still waited 30 minutes to be sat at a table, and then waited another 15 minutes before being approached by a server.  the manager who was very visible just seemed to be busily walking back and forth but didn't appear to really do anything.

for those who have never had the pleasure of dining at a brazilian steakhouse, the way it usually works is there's a salad bar full of side dishes and then waiters come around and carve freshly cooked meats at your table.  when our drink orders were finally taken we approached the salad bar.  most of the items looked extremely thirsty like it had been sitting out for a while, and this place was super busy!  the lettuce for the salad wasn't wilted but still looked extremely dry.  mashed potatoes had that yellowish ""skin"" formed on it.  the one form of salami that they had tasted borderline bad.  the cheese plate was all poured together with no care what-so-ever.  the brazilian cheese rolls which most brazilian steakhouses are famous for were dry and tasteless.

when the meat (the whole reason, in my opinion, that you pay almost $50 a person for) finally arrived to the table it was a total disappointment.  the first dish was garlic sirloin.  it was so tough i couldn't cut it into pieces small enough to eat.  my husband's piece was horribly rare and also tough.  the next dish was leg of lamb which is the whole reason i took my husband here.  it literally resembled shoe leather, and like the last dish could barely be cut with a steak knife.

i really really hate to complain while dining at a restaurant especially while on vacation, but this was just a horrible experience that i was about to pay top dollar for.  when our waiter came to check on us, we showed him the state of the meat that we received thus far.  he, of course, apologized profusely and set out to make things right for us.  he got us clean plates and called over some waiters with different cuts of meat one of which said that he saw the leg of lamb we complained about, and agreed that there was no excuse for that.  the new meats were still only fair, to be honest, but at that point, i just wanted out of there.  we paid our full bill and left.  the manager at this point was nowhere to be found, so whether or not anyone told him about our complaints is anyone's guess.

my husband and i have been to this type of restaurant several times in several states.  none of them have had meats of such poor quality, in my opinion.  the whole point of going to a brazilian steakhouse is because you want well-prepared meats.  someone needs to tell whoever is in charge of purchasing the meat in this restaurant to aim a little higher.  my cats eat better food than what was served to us tonight.",1,0,0.9999900281494196

walking in, we were greeted right away, and sat right away. after being seated, we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone. finally, we were approached by our waiter, who said he would be with us in a few minutes. what?! the fifteen minute wait wasn't bad enough? 

when he finally came bakc ,we ordered our drinks. we all got alcoholic drinks - and i also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal. upon returning, he brought back water in a glass bottle. now, i've been to restaurants before, where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy - so i thought that's what this restaurant did too. wrong. 

after seeing a couple tables next to us, with just regular cups of water, we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the tap water we had asked for. he said no, and that they charged for each bottle. we asked how much it was for each bottle, and he said he didn't know and would go find out. there were two things wrong with this situation:
     1. how the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs? as a server, you should know your menu inside and out. 
      2. it took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price, which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink, because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water. 

0 stars for service. 

as for the food, bleh. everything was salty and overcooked. they came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage, but we were only offered their beef items a few times. as for their salad bar, they had a lot of choices, but none of them really worth while. i will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good. actually, it was the highlight of the meal. it was the only thing that was actually good.

we were seated to see 3 rodizio servers in our section and were quite excited to get the rodizio experience started.  however, it took about 5 minutes for our server to come and take our drink order.  we then went to the salad/side bar to get our sides and returned to our table.  we flipped the token to green to indicate we wanted to be served but we wound up waiting and waiting.  in the first 15 minutes at our table, we were offered only 2 meats.  meanwhile our sides got cold.  service was horrible.  we wound up keeping our token up signaling we wanted service the whole time.  there was one server who wouldn't even stop at our table.  it was as if we were invisible to her.  to top it all off the meat wasn't even that good.

the meat service was slow; you had to yell at the meat carvers to get them to stop at your table, and there were 10, 15 minutes intervals when they would just not come out at all. the meats were salty and tough, with the exception of the rib eye which was ok.

1. it was at planet hollywood, where there's free parking and the coolest casino, where we were going to play at the tables later;
2. we had a 2-for-1 coupon.
we made a reservation, but at 6:00 on saturday night we would have been ok without it; however, when we left at 7:30, there was a lineup of 50 people waiting. suggestion: reserve by calling, or using opentable app.
we ordered the rodizio dinner - endless meats (12 selections) plus endless shrimp plus salad bar. normally $68 per person, but 2-for-1 made it $34 each. not a bad price for really good food, and lots of it.
caveat: you also have to order a beverage (didn't see that on the coupon), so we went with the one-hour open bar for $20 (per person). 
wife hit the salad bar; i did not. why waste tummy room on veggies and cheese. i did check it out, and it looked good; but i was there for the meats.
all of them were tasty - especially the sausage and the sirloin options.
grilled shrimps came 8 at a time with a really tasty homemade teriyaki sauce, which was so good that i was putting it on everything i ate - including the grilled pineapple.
our server was amber. she was awesome. she fully explained the coupon before we ordered (a party sat after we did but weren't aware of the wording and pricing. amber explained it, and told them to take some time to think about it, enjoy a glass of water and she'd be back to check on them. i tried to convince them to stay and eat, but they ended up leaving). she made drink suggestions, informed us on how the evening would go, and offered to get me a special plate of well done meats. she was jovial and attentive to all her tables. she kept the drinks coming and even introduced us to the manager (we were talking to her about using an ipad and app for seating tables, rather than the white board and dry erase marker the hostess was using. the manager agreed, and informed us that someone dropped the ipad a few days earlier)(for shits and giggles, on the way out, i asked the hostess if i could see the white board so i could check my email. she just smiled.)

over the last decade or so, i've eaten here for holidays, casual meals, romantic dinners, catered events and even bachelor parties, but i've never had a single bad experience or known anyone who has. it seems to be an extremely well-run restaurant with an attentive staff that's eager to meet every customer's needs. 

whether you're a ""rare"" individual, a stickler for ""well-done"" steak, or even a staunch vegetarian, this place will make sure you leave happy. and in a tourist town like vegas where customer service is king, the importance of that quality can't be overstated. 

plus, there are always a bunch of coupons and deals you can find online that will make your bill even cheaper!

i explained to the server that we had the groupon and he looked at it, and told us we made the best choice on the menu, and explained how things worked.  we received excellent service throughout the meal - attentive, polite, respectful.  towards the end, when we were obviously stuffed, our served asked me if there was anything else i wanted.  i requested one more serving of the chinese pork, which appeared about thirty seconds later.

shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops
three different kinds of beef, including bacon wrapped filet
salmon and shark
chinese style pork
grilled chicken
ham
pineapple

our decision was solidified when we found a remarkable deal on groupon for a surf and turf dinner, but in reality it should've been the first red flag we were dealt a bad hand. 

the atmosphere, quality of food and limited options on the buffet were the worst of the experience. only the waiter made it slightly more enjoyable. 

greeted at the hostess stand with a ""hey big balla"" because of our groupon reservation, we were seated in at a table about a foot from 118"" tv screen in the middle of the bar. that was the final straw before the meal was even served. 

we were dropped off by an uber driver who remarked ""it used to be good, but customers said it made them sick recently,"" but even with his discouraging comment we navigated through the busy mall to a restaurant slightly nicer than an applebee's in a food court. 

the salad bar had only a few items on cold plates. not what you'd expect if you've frequently visited other brazilian steakhouses. once the meat started flowing everyone tried limited options. the sirloin was dripping blood, the filet was caked in parmasian cheese and the tri tip was too salty to eat. the dessert tasted like it was from sam's and the alcohol was so bad it couldn't even wash down the taste.

sat down and went to the salad bar, which was pretty good, but not as extensive as i've seen at other churrascarias/ all you can eat meat buffets.  the seafood pasta in the cream sauce was my favorite.  the only sauces available here were 2 kinds of chimmichurri, no horseradish creme sauce or regular horseradish which i typically enjoy with my steak. only green i saw was kale and that was actually pretty tasty. 

the guys cutting the meat did not smile. in fact, i don't think one of them cracked a smile the whole time, they definitely need to be more friendly.  they looked like they were in pain each time they came over and would rather be hanging themselves than working.

i also never saw lamb. i looked and looked for it, but it never showed up. bah bah lamb.  i think they only have 1/2 of the options they tell you they do.  the most memorable items were:  the bacon wrapped scallops, grilled shrimp, and the roasted crispy chicken.  the steak for me was outback at best and again i did not see as many options as i thought there should be.  the trout and other mystery white fish should be avoided.

no dessert options either or at least a little something sweet to eat would've been nice.

In-_4DX-Jr3XaU-eiGVJPw,2013,"i came here with my girlfriend on a tuesday evening and i honestly never even knew this restaurant existed. we had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. first off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. it still isn't a bad deal because i think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.

it was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign i guess. the waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. i was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. this includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. my girlfriend chose the margarita and i chose the mojito. i feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.

the salad bar isn't really that big compared to via brasil and texas de brazil. regardless, i enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might i add). i know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.

ok, now the meat and seafood. the shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. they do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. the mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was ok - nothing too amazing about it. i think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. my girlfriend really really liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.

for dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good.

last but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. he kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.

overall i think this place was ok....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it. if it were up to me i'd probably just go to via brasil especially since it is only 5 min from my house. i don't think we'll come back to pampas.",2,1,0.09273252517812391

server: we had constantin for our server. he was incredible. he was welcoming, friendly, comedic (appropriately), and down to earth. where some people give a lower level of service when you have a groupon he did not. he even reminded us that the groupon includes dessert and to save room!

ambiance: i did get the feeling that they tend to seat groupon customers closer to the bar area so you don't get the full feeling of the ambiance of the restaurant however it was still a great table and the bar wasn't loud at all.

food: where do i begin? wow! i was beyond impressed. perhaps i had low expectations after reading some of the poor reviews but i loved everything! my favorites: the bacon wrapped filet mignon, the flank steak, and the roasted chicken. these were incredible and my mouth is literally watering thinking of the flavor and juiciness of these foods. i was there only two nights ago and i am still drooling! the salad bar is wonderful- try the fried bananas! the white chocolate cheesecake- phenomenal. i was too full to finish all of it (constantin had warned us!) but it was so good! 

the waiters kept coming around with more and more meats. i could have sat there and ate all night however we had a show to get to and i was stuffed! 

i am not sure what happened with the poor reviews. we had great service, the food and drinks were excellent, and they weren't snobby about us having a groupon. i will be back!",5,1,0.005977431749256468

we made reservations and were promptly seated within 10 minutes. the salad bar is amazing. theres so much selection, but just the right amount. theres a little something for everyone ! soup, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, salads, breads, and even some pasta and rice. 

onto the meats, the bbq pork was sensational. well done, yet moist and tender, just the right amount of seasoning and glaze. it was amazing. prime rib and scallops were also amazing. could not get enough of the shrimp ! the chicken and ham were okay, not bad but forgetable. 

the service was great. the cooks slicing the meats were very kind and had great sense of humor. our waitress was amazing. she came at all the right times, and came by just enough. 

as we were leaving , i asked for the bill, and to my suprise ir was $1.40 , i waved our waitress over thinking this was an error, but it wasnt ! she decided to not charge us for 2 beers and an iced tea because our table was not ready at exactly oue reservation time !

we went for lunch, the restaurant was semi-busy as we waited for the others to join.  by the time our entire group arrived, it was a steady pace of traffic.  seated guests and take-out guests, yasssss you can do like -
 ayce chinese buffet take out - you know the place where they let you pack your own styrofoam, yes, the option is available.

very clean restaurant, kind staff, great customer service and very fast service.  so they give you give you approx. 20 mins to go attack the salad bar.  o-m-g, cheese biscuits, let me say it again chhheeeeessssseee biscuits and gluten free.  not that that really matters to me, just wanted to throw that out.  my fat a$$ had about 12 of them, but wait dip the cheese biscuit into the bean soup...shut the front door.  so freaking good!  a variety of salads; beat salad, green bean salad, olives, no iceberg (not even for decoration) ""thank you, i really appreciate that"" multi- bean salads, quinoa salad, fresh fruit and veggies.  other soups available that day italian wedding and chicken soup.  but the bean soup, it reminds me of red beans w/ hamhock that's been slow cooking all day w/ the perfect season.  (don't judge me and my food choices, it's good, shoo) not too salty yet still flavorful, salt is not needed but that is just my personal opinion. on to the meats....

don't get full off the salad bar, here come the passadores come and it's...about...to...go....down! (well, it went down)  bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, italian sausage, pork chops, ham; really good stuff.  meat tender and juciy, no extras needed.  simple seasoning, salt and pepper, sizzling and piping hot flying out the the kitchen.  even if you turn the card over, the passadores still may if you would like any more...and guess, you ended up saying yes,even though you are stuff.  but it is so good.

bQAt4PF_WY4tKhuh_ewBCQ,2010,"worst restaurant i have ever been to, the food is mediocre but worse service simply cannot be found anywhere else.  my party of 11 had reservations for pampas....even so, it took them more than 45 minutes to get us our table.  most waiters look forward to large parties - lots of potential for tips - however ours avoided us.

the menu has some good offerings on it.  however, because it had taken so long to seat us and our waiter was not being attentive, most of us ordered the salad bar because we were running short on time.  irritated that the majority of the party was not ordering the most expensive thing on the menu (keep in mind, we were a group of well dressed, well-to-do people), the waiter began collecting up rodizio plates from the table as loud as he possibly could, as if being passive-aggressive would put more time on the clock for us.  we then pointed out that he'd failed to take the meal orders from three of the people in our party, which irritated him further.  he mistakenly collected a rodizio plate from one of the party who ordered the meat rodizio (the all you can eat meat) and when the diner informed him that he shouldn't have taken the plate away, argued with the diner for 5 minutes before checking what he himself had written down for the meal order.

the food at the salad bar was decent - good variety and mostly well done, and does a good job as light fare.  the people who were most disappointed were those who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat.  the menu said it was a ""neverending parade of meats"".  in actuality, they were not served for 20 minutes while the rest of us were eating from the bar, and neither was anybody else in the restaurant.  the manager stopped by to ask if people were getting their meats, to which we told him no, not in the past 20 minutes.  i'm guessing he chewed out the wait staff, because a slow trickle of the rotiserrie spear holding waiters slowly started making their rounds, albeit it was far from being a ""neverending parade"" and all of the servers appeared sour and grouchy that they were being made to work.  most would come by, cut off one small slice, and walk off leaving my friends sitting there trying to flag them down for more.

as for the meat itself?  nothing special.  most of it was overcooked.  the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but how often is bacon-wrapped anything bad?  overall it was very disappointing for the price tag, and the people who were most satisfied were those who just got the $19 salad bar because they were either not hungry or in a rush to leave.

funnily enough, they have red and green markers to be put on the table, green to sign servers to bring more meat, red to tell them that you're full.  the diners in my party that ordered the all you can eat meat finished dinner hungry and turning the markers to red just so that we could collect our checks and continue with our night.

as for the rude waiter?  he was delinquent in refilling our drink orders (and 11 people on their way to a club can order a lot of drinks) to the point that on more than one occasion members of my party walked to the bar to order drinks.  when we asked him to split our checks, he became visibly irritated with us.....lets see, a group of 11 people, four couples and some single guys, why would separate checks with the mandatory gratuity added not make sense?  not many 28-30 year olds pay for 10 friends to eat at an expensive restaurant like this...  the waiter then went around the table and argued with every one of us about our drink orders (which wasn't much thanks to him being awol).  15 minutes later, he tosses down the drink bill and basically said he made no effort to try to break it up.

in the end, the one thing our waiter did right was not add gratuity to both the food bill and the drink bill.  everybody in my party of 11 gave him exactly what he earned and deserved for his tip: $0.00 .

if you're looking for all you can eat and quality, go to the buffet at the mgm grand or the aria.  if you're looking for bad service, go to dick's last resort - their bad service is at least entertaining and their prices are more reasonable (and quality of food is sadly comparable).  there is no reason for anybody to ever eat at pampas.",1,0,0.9999540855157045

maybe i have been spoiled with fogo de chao and gaucho's village in la. but i have also been to smaller brazilian steakhouses and experienced much better. 

we came in with a reservation late on a saturday night. we were seated right away. we went with the rodizio which is the all you can eat churrasco with the salad bar. i don't know if it was because it was late at during the night but it wasn't like the place was empty and people were continuing to come in through out our stay. the 'gaucho's' took forever to come out. i mean, they were nowhere in sight.

they finally came by with some filet mignon with parmesan cheese. it was good but nothing special. interesting flavor but nothing to rave about. they then brought some ham which the bf said was good. i had some brazilian sausage that was good. they kept bringing out the filet mignon and i wanted some picanha, some lamb.... something they did not bring until 45 minutes- 1 hour that we had been there. by that time, appetite was gone. still tried some of the picanha but it was meh. they also did not ask how we wanted it (medium- medium rare, etc) which is not a requirement but i have always been asked that at churrascarias. pan de queijo was pretty good, and since the meat took so long, we filled up on that. good, but not worth a 40+ dollar meal for cheese bread!

you can always ask the ""meat guys(lack of a better name)"" to give you the inside/ouside meat and rare/medium/well or however you like it!

some of the cuts were a little more rare than i would eat, but all the meats come to the table cooked at different temperatures. my favorite was the grilled chicken wrapped in bacon. it was juicy and flavorful. they also had grilled pineapples, which was my 2nd favorite item. this restaurant also has a side bar where you can get fruit, salads, pastas, etc. i would definitely return to a restaurant of this caliber.  rating all the way.",5,1,0.001292983769556666
Nd1YwjPE5A-9UPrfBI24Hg,2018,"update on review:  i was re-invited to pampas after addressing some concerns from a previous experience.  i'm glad i was re-invited.  this is a favorite for my son and it has moved back up on my list as well.  

first, my son and i usually opt for the travelzoo voucher which includes all meats along with a pitcher of sangria.  we made reservations and a table was ready for us immediately upon arrival.  the hostess, as usual, was very polite and friendly.  

upon being seated, our waiter alex greeted us and advised that he would return for our drink order.  it is nice when your server acknowledges your presence and notices you that he will return promptly.  that he did.  we ordered the white sangria pitcher along with two brazilian limeades.  we patron two other brazilian steakhouses and pampas has the best limeades of them all.  

our table was soon visited by gustavo - with pampas.  gustavo was very accommodating and it was nice to see part of pampas management team take time to greet patrons at their table.  this style reinforces good customer service and exceptional attention to service.  

the salad bar had a variety of selections to ensure you keep healthy!  good assortment of vegetables, pasta, and other delicacies that compliment the meat selections.  

here is the best part:  the meats/cuts: from experiencing the other two main brazilian steakhouses in vegas - pampas cuts are not saturated with sodium.  that is a major turn off from other establishments - too much sodium.  not at pampas.  the cuts at pampas seem to have just the right amount so as to not inflame the gums!  the gentlemen were at our table offering their selection and - you can simply request a particular cut of preference and they will bring it right over.  their lamb is great too!  

overall, the experience was exceptional and made me forget the past experience.  previously, the first few times we patroned pampas - the service was good.  so the poor experience appears to be an exception.  i'm just glad pampas re-invited us and regained our patronage.  my son was definitely happy with our experience.

recommendation: absolutely.  definitely get yourself the white sangria pitcher.  it complements the meal with perfection.",5,1,0.005507460674755271

turkey wrapped in bacon was probably the best thing they offered me.

the sides/salad bar was pretty small and not a great variety. which really doesn't matter so much to me because i just get some rice and the powder stuff for dipping the meat in.

servers were either all robots, or all hungover... no life to them.
and they sure took their sweet time coming out from the back... don't they know to not keep food from me like that? maybe that is why the knives were duller than a party at joe biden's.

tAEfAt9iZ_hx-O7YATfqDA,2013,"within the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood there are probably 10 sit-down restaurant options - more so than your average lv casino/resort.  so with so many choices, we were a little disappointed in our choice on saturday night. 

this was our first experience to the brazilian steakhouse concept (think fogo de chao etc).  the main entree is an endless parade of skewers to your table where the meat, seafood, chicken is taken off the large skewer for you.  

at pampas, the salad bar and sides were excellent although the area was small in size and thus crowded at times.  the salad bar is a square with no real beginning.  thus, if it's crowded, jumping in somewhere was difficult. this was a saturday, in las vegas, with a concert at the ph live venue. 

as for the main entree, the steaks were tough.  really, really tough.  flavorful, but very hard to chew.  the lamb was good, and the chicken also good.  however folks, the price of this meal is just under $40 pp.  in all, the food quality, although plentiful, was not good enough to warrant the price. 

also, our waiter emphasized the value of getting a bottle of their house wine and we could take our unfinished portion anywhere in vegas.  we are experienced travelers, restaurant goers etc and he caught us with our guard down.  we ordered the bottle half-way through our meal, in lieu of a second round of wine by the glass.  we do understand that a reasonably priced bottle is often a better value than wine by the glass, if the table is drinking the same (red v. white).   in this case, we made a mistake because we didn't finish the bottle as we were heading home the next evening.  we knew better but...still.  (it's like making that one extra bet at the casino where that tiny voice says no...but the larger, alcohol influenced part of the brain says go for it...and the result:  not so good!).",2,0,0.6997368763868195

vKs95AISVR-YweZF1O5V2Q,2016,"we were in vegas for a short getaway trip and decided to buy the groupon for lunch at pampas.  this groupon is good for 2 people and includes 2 cocktails and a dessert to share.  we never tried a brazilian style buffet restaurant before, so we were super excited to try it out.  

the restaurant is kinda tucked away in the in-door shoppes at the planet hollywood casino.  we arrived around 3pm and the place was pretty busy.  the decor and atmosphere was very nice and upbeat.  all the staff appeared to be well dressed and professional.  there was a 15 minute wait to be seated and we were seated near the bar.  our waiter was very nice and attentive.  even the manager came around a couple of times to make sure everything was excellent.  we were given this fancy eco-friendly water from a large chilled bottle...awesome!

ok, now on to the feast...the kitchen staff came around on a regular basis with ginormous meats on a stick (get your mind out of the gutter), but how fantastic is that!  a great variety of meats that included juicy filet mignons and perfectly cooked lamb.  huge prawn and steak was brought out on a plate.  the salad bar was really good along with the soups.

the groupon included 2 cocktails and our waiter said we could choose any drink worth up to $10.  great, we ordered a pina colada and a house special.  the dessert selection was just ok, but the cheesecake, that we ordered, was scrumdibliumtious.

i would highly recommend buying this groupon, especially when there is additional 20% code.  we ended up paying close to $40 when groupon had 25% off deals.  without this groupon, you would be paying close to $100 for 2 people at the restaurant.",4,1,0.001899780559955988

the private room did not disappoint, in fact the entire comfortable vibe of the room fit our group of seventeen perfectly. pampas served us several different types and cuts for meat. the bacon wrapped chicken was our first serving, but only our first. we enjoyed steak, lamb, and more pork. everyone enjoyed their meal. our vp is a little picky about his wines. so picky that he is known to send glasses back. at our dinner he liked the wine so much he ordered a total of three bottles for the entire table. other drinks were provided for everyone as well.

our private room allowed us to discuss company matters. it allowed us privacy. yet still, we had some of the most attentive, and ready staff at any place we've eaten.  the next day, everyone shared e-mails together about how great our meals went.

the salad bar is generous, i highly recommend the little cheese breads as well as the mashed potatoes- they were delicious.

there is a lot of meat to review so i will note the standouts:

the bacon wrapped chicken- it was juicy and flavorful and tasty overall
.
the sirloin- you can select how rare you went it right off the sword- it was tender and the seasonings were great.

the barbequed pork- okay, i'm am genuinely not a fan of pork (with the exception of the occasional bacon added or wrapped item or holiday ham) but this was probably the best thing there. it was delicious- savory, sweet and juicy, i couldn't believe it. even if you do not like pork or ham you have to try it!

in the 15 minutes since we sat down and got salad, the gauchos showed up only once to serve small pieces of pork. compared to other churrascarias, where you'll practically be bombarded with meat, the dining room is a ghost town!

other brazilian steakhouses will wait in line to give you meat. here, you'll easily wait 15+ minutes between cuts of meat. when we asked for faster service, the meat started coming out rare, indicating they were rushing things or maybe low on capacity. did you come to this steakhouse for steak? too bad, you won't get any -- much less the cheaper sausages, chicken or other cuts that other churrascarias start with to fill you up!

also, they have a photographer going between tables and promising ""free"" photos. of course, they're free to take, but cost big, big money to buy! this wasn't very professional and, though vegas is admittedly a huge tourist destination, you won't find this at a fogo or tdb.

ultimately, if you'd like to leave hungrier than if you'd had a $2 box of special k at home, come here. if you'd like to blow $30 per person for $10 worth of meat max, come here. but if you want to experience a true brazilian steakhouse, one that rewards your time and money, skip this overpriced tourist trap and head to fogo de chao. you won't regret it.",1,0,0.9276868488597407

starting off, the place looks nice. dimly lit and fits the mood of a relaxed dinner. the dining room is well spaced and even when full you can move around freely. the waiters and waitresses have always been friendly and accommodating. even joking and being friendly, that's always something i'll consider good customer service. let's take it away to the food and start with the salad bar which is where i'm knocking off a star. the variety here is nice. you have fruit salads, make your own salad, deep fried bananas to biscuits and soups. some light pasta salads, everything very light. the problem being is some of the items are hit and miss. hot items aren't always hot, potatoes can be under seasoned or straight up bland. i've had an item or toe where i can easily say i wouldn't want to try it again. luckily majority of these items are good with only one or two stinkers.

the meat has always been the rave of the place for me. i've never had an experience with any sort of over salting, over seasoning or over cooking. the meat is always prepared and as a fan of filet mignon i will say theirs is excellent. i was even treated to a personal filet mignon dish after i went there for graduation. they weren't serving the item yet but created some for us. if that's not a great gesture then i don't know what is.

a couple ahead of us left because they were tired of waiting and had show tickets. that bumped us up. we were seated next to an empty table which had been dirty for the whole time we had been waiting.

for starters, the meats came around so slowly still. this time it was much slower. i thought i was crazy until the 2 tables next to me start complaining also. i don't know what their problem is but it's unacceptable. i ended up eating the same 4 meats over and over. we all waited 10 minutes between servings too.

i then noticed, when a table next to me started to order dessert, that not only my favorite but the only dessert i will eat from this place (the chocolate mousse brownie), wasn't on the display. i asked my server about it and he said that they had taken it off of the menu. i posted a tip about it and a rude supporter of this place (the company's fake yelp account probably) told me to get my facts straight.

i walked to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. the manager came over after about 5 minutes. i told her that it was like my 6th time eating there and the experiences and food are both getting worse. she weirdly listened for a couple minutes and then asked if i wanted a free dessert or drink. i declined both. i wanted her to understand that i wasn't complaining to start trouble or get free stuff. i was complaining because i was truly concerned. she finally offered me a bogo for my next visit. little does she know, i will never use it, because i will never go back.

i have officially added this place to my ""never again"" list.",1,0,0.9980367605065155

this review is solely based on my own honest opinion in regards to a recent visit at said establishment and not being posted out of any malice or slander.

i have several complaints. 
first, when you are seated, the waiter poured each of us a glass of water. after we all took a drink of the water, he then told us that this restaurant belongs to some kind of water conservation program and that we were each going to be charged an additional $1.00 per person for the table water. what a scam.
second, the service was so slow. the waiter comes to your table every so often and only gives you two slices of meat.  i had to constantly call for the waiter to come for more meat.
third, i asked for the tarasco steak and was told there is none.
fourth, when the girl comes to take your free photo, say no right away or you will regret it later. trust me on this one. 
i was with a party of four people and we all agreed that we did not have a good dining experience here and the water surcharge is tacky, to say the least. i will never go back and i would not recommend this establishment to anyone.",1,0,0.991513151999799

first off, we bought the surf & turf rodizio on groupon for 2. the photo for this groupon was on steak & lobster... we arrive, got seated and was told there is no lobster included in our meal... instead we are served a plate with wilted fish, peel and eat shrimp & broken old looking mussels! we were told this was unlimited... the only thing we asked more of was the salmon & they finally delivered a piece, 25 minutes later.

we had to ask several busboys  for meat to be brought by our table because we sat for at least 10 minutes with nothing on our plates. not quick at all on meat circulation. finally after waiting more, the meat came out way.. 

i feel completely mislead by the description of this meal and then customer service experience was horrible! 

there was a check in option on yelp for a bottle of wine. i was denied the bottle of wine because the waitress said we didn't buy a full price meal? shouldn't that be stipulated on check in? free bottle of wine with purchase of a full priced meal for checking in? again, misled....

during lunch, they only serve seven meats--ham and pineapple, sausage, spicy chicken, barbeque chicken, turkey wrapped in bacon, and two other meats i cannot remember.  they do not have my favorites-- filet mignon wrapped in bacon and sausage with melted cheese.   the pineapple is very juicy and delicious.  for some reason, their pineapple tasted juicier than rei do gado or texas de brazil.

this was my first brazilian steakhouse, so i don't have anything else to compare it to. i notice a lot of reviews state that this isn't as good as ___insert another brazilian steakhouse here___. my review will probably be on the higher side as a result.

the ambiance is beautiful. i really liked how it felt somewhat romantic, but i think it would have been a good spot even for a bunch of friends or family. the waiter boasted of the salad bar but i didn't think that they had a lot of great choices. it was a bit of a let down. the soups were soo good though, as was some of the cold pasta salads, so there was enough for me to eat. (don't miss out on the cheesy bread either! it was my favorite non-meat item.)

the meats-
-everything bacon wrapped was delicious, but then again what isn't?
-sirloin. we had them keep bringing it back. so moist, perfectly seasoned and the definition of a good piece of meat.
-grilled pineapple. not really a meat but it was brought out in the same fashion. loved it! wish that they served it with the ham though. by the time the ham was brought out, the pineapple guy was nowhere in sight.

BaOF1ZsNEftlSNJCeP0ryg,2019,"i got a free $57 dinner here oct 2018 as part of my gifts for attending a vacation club presentation.  i also got a free show.  if you wanna get these gifts and free lunch (just prepackaged sandwiches, chips, popcorn), go through the west-facing entrance (on las vegas blvd) of miracle mile shopping center and right inside the entrance is a horseshoe counter in the center, displaying posters of various lv shows.  that counter will sign you up for a vacation presentation where one of the things you get is a dinner here at pampas.  but this was oct 2018, not sure about ""today"" when you are reading this. 

 i tried to cut the presentation short, but the saleswoman insisted on showing me a suite for 8, when i told her alone is all i know and it would just make me so sad that i had no one to share it with.  i yelled, ""get me outta here!!  it makes me sad.   i just want my gifts !"", in front of other people who were being shown the suite.  she got it !  she hurried me outta there.  cost me 2 hours at the presentation, but i still think it is worth the free show and pampas dinner.  i ate my pampas dinner alone, cos remember, alone is all i know.

i sat at the bar at first, cos they didn't have a table for me.  anyhow the meat pampas brought around to my seat, was not rare enough for me but when i said so, the servers told me they would be back with meat cooked the way i liked it.  and they did remember me.  so i think the service was .  but some of the meats like chicken, were overcooked and dry, except the lamb.  even rare was not that chewable, and had gristle and things i spit out.   the thing i liked the most about eating all the meats was the chimichurri sauce.  i love chimichurri sauce.  i had them bring me that in a bowl.  

i didn't find the salad bar very appealing.  only thing i liked and ate from it was the beets and the hearts of palm.  that's ok, i don't go to a meat buffet to eat ""salad"".  

 i read the reviews about the charge for the water bottles, and told them i didn't want ""those bottles"".  the bartender gave me free water in a small cup.  he also gave me tastes of drinks i was asking ""what was that"", but i don't remember what ""that"" was now.  

i found the waste at other tables appalling.  i talked to the couple at the next table (we were about 2 feet away).  they paid extra money to upgrade to seafood offerings.  they had a bowl full of large shrimp.  that bowl stayed uneaten and full for the duration of their dinner.  when they got their jacket and things to leave the table, i said ""i can't believe you are leaving that bowl full of jumbo shrimp"".  they said, ""we are just too full !""   then someone came to clean up their table right away, and stacked the shrimp on the tray with other dirty dishes to be thrown away.

if you come here and pay full price you are silly...as they have 2 for 1 offerings all over town and on the internet if you search long enough...and that is reason enough to try it out and think, well, $20-$25 per person is somewhat reasonable as their competition in town seldom offers deals and you end up paying over $120 for two (tax +tip) but for far better quality and excellent salad bar.

service:
the last time i was here, we sat for over 7 minutes to start out our meal before we had a ""gaucho"" come over ready to carve out some meat...and they aren't that personable like in some other places, kind of robotic.

the salad bar doesn't have much...throw a couple hearts of palm on my plate and i'm done...not going to fill up on fettuccini alfredo.

the best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsamic vinegar mix they use to sauce it over, but of course that came around once over the course of an hour and we were sitting in the middle of the room.

the filet mignon is bacon wrapped and too salty and extremely tough for what is supposed to be the most tender cut of meat...and i hope you like it medium-well because that's all they had.

after being seated, we got some food from the buffet and waited for the meat with our green circle clearly visible. after 4 rounds, it seemed our table was invisible as we kept getting passed over...this happened for 20 minutes. to get their attention my friend lifted the green circle up in her hand and after 3 minutes suddenly we had 3 servers at our table.

my party of 6 called for a dinner reservation prior to 6 pm and was told it was unnecessary.  we had a very long night prior and did not wake to have breakfast or lunch.  we were famished as our last meal was the evening before.  we arrived at 7:45 pm and was told our wait would be approximately 20 minutes.  an hour later, we were seated.  a wonderful gentleman (the food runner, i assume) assisted my party and i.  he was very attentive and amiable.  unfortunately, he was the only one who was such.  this gentleman filled our glasses immediately as we sat.  and we sat, and we sat.  and we stared at our 6 glasses of water.  a server never came.  we thought we were lucky when the manager stated he would assist and tend to our table.  then we saw him walk out with his backpack and we were again left with no server.  

the entire pampas dining experience was horrid.  we came to celebrate the birthday of a person in my party and her happiest moment was when we left.  at 10:30 pm.  this is when the party begins...

birthday girl doesn't feel well and returns to the room to lay down.  one member of the party has bubble gut and excuses herself.  another member utilizes liquid courage to help with her stomach pains as i sit in the casino drinking nothing but water and a can of sugar free red bull to ease the aching.  i proceeded to throw up 3 times in the restroom of the casino, 5 times on the floor of the casino, and 3 more times at the emergency room.  though the rest of my party was also sick, my sickness was much more magnified due to my type 1 diabetes and the fear of any other underlying issues.  

er copay:  $150
missing departure flight:  $220
being a vegetarian at pampas:  priceless
(the 2 members who did not fall ill were vegetarians)

two nights in the hospital, i missed my return flight home, 6.5 months later and my stomach still isn't the same.  i've travelled all over the world, eaten overseas, never had any issues as it relates to having a sensitive tummy.  somehow, pampas got us -- me, especially.  

this review is not only a reflection of the food and the service, but also the lack of good management.  the day i was released from the hospital, i called to speak with pampas' management to inform them of my party's issue.  my name and number was given.  that was february 19th, 2016.  i called two separate times and to this day, have not heard from one member of management.  

is there a possibility i give negative stars?  because pampas, you owe my party and i some stars.",1,0,0.9952660132602617
ISstHkKcXQ-IEFvKQ_kXcg,2019,we started with a 1/2 hour wait with our reservation i say why have reservations it has no advantage.  they want to put us in what they call outside seating.  this area was seating with all the people waiting to be seated too. who would want to be eating with all these people standing around you watching you eat. the side dishes in the buffet style was good and fresh.  then the meat started coming and what a disappointment it was most of the meat was served way over done.  the best two items we had was ham and the other was pineapple. we had the groupon and it was $138 for 4 people.  they charged $1.00 for water i guess it was $1 per bottle that is filled with just filtered water it was $12 at the end just for water.  the one item you would expect to be the best was filet mignon and it was so well done and i don't know where they get the meat from but i have had better meat from 7-11 gas station.,2,0,0.6858768795227446

what i wasn't pleased with and it's very small was the fact that there is a water conservation charge if you drink water...... water that they give to you without you asking for it and without telling you there will be a charge. it is mentioned  on the menu but it will not be pointed out to you . the charge is only $2.00 but it's the fact that you wouldn't let your customer  know before hand that you are gonna charge for thirst quenching , life saving , free, water . the table next to me was a voucher couple as well they complained to the manager and got it removed. i wild have too if it was higher priced and i'm sure that's what they are counting on , that the price isn't high enough to care.  unfortunately for the server it did cost him a bit of a tip just because i would like to have been told of the secret  charge

BmP4vpYU_O5loYwF4M45wA,2017,"we received a voucher for this restaurant and decided to try their lunch buffet. three of us went for the meat buffet ($21/person), one got the seafood and meat buffet ($30/person). there is a small buffet bar at the back where they have some fruits, salads, rice, and pasta (included in the price). they also have some entrees available instead of the buffet. 

unlike a regular buffet, servers will come around with the meat and cut you a piece from the skewers. for seafood, you are given a seafood platter with shrimp, mussels, salmon, and tilapia. you can ask your server for refills for seafood.

some meat that came around included sirloin steak, pork chops, bacon chicken, pineapple and ham, and chicken legs.

my favourite was the pineapple and ham. the salty ham and sour pineapple were perfect when eaten together. i didn't eat much of beef, but my family said it was very juicy and tender. the spices used for the pork was good, but there was a strong ""pig"" taste in it. it would've been better if they used more spices to cover up the taste. the chicken was extremely dry, rough, and overcooked.

the shrimp from the seafood platter was probably the best out of the platter. they were fresh and not too salty. the mussels were very salty and didn't taste very fresh. the salmon was very dry and thin (i prefer thick cuts). the tilapia doesn't even taste like fish.

VW296-Wf9Y1GIfaeyMCHaQ,2018,"visit on 05/11/2018 at 8:45 p.m.; two for dining; travelzoo voucher;  terrible experience.  the waiter we had was non-existent.  we were seated by a polite hostess - who was courteous and prompt in seating us.   35 minutes later - we were served water.  not an exaggeration.  it took our waiter 35 minutes to bring us water for the first time.   i've been here before and there was no excuse for such delay.  eventually, i  asked an employee to invite the manager to our table.  despite this request, the manager never showed up. 

in addition to the long wait for water - one of the glasses on our table was filthy.  it had a chunk of dried food.  we asked our waiter to serve us the pitcher of white sangria.  that took another 25 minutes.  by this time, we were almost done with our meal. 

to make it worse - one of the employees begins questioning why we only had one tong for the meats.  i thought the guy was being polite and would offer to bring a second one to our table.  unfortunately, that was not his intent.  instead, this guy claims that when one tong is on the table - that means only one person paid for the all you can eat.  this caught me off guard.  i gave him a dirty look and instructed him to address this issue with the waiter and not to be quizzing me while having dinner.  this employee's inquiry was borderline slander.  

the hostess along with one gentleman (asian older man with glasses) were very professional, attentive, and are getting a bad rep as a result of the such poor service by their colleagues.

nQ0VXhI5nu3DrHmdOAhh2g,2018,"pampa's seems to have gone seriously downhill.
 so many things went wrong with our visit today. 
while trying to get to the salad/hot food bar the kitchen took this time to change everything at the same time! much was full, they were pulling every food item & breaking up all of the ice. the sauteed kale used to be good, it is so many different levels of being cooked in 1 pan it's rediculous. there was everything to basically fresh non cooked kale to it's been sitting in the warming pan for a good hour all mixed together. if the cooks don't like kale they need to learn that customers do like it & cook it correctly, it tasted like they may have sauteed it once that day then kept adding raw from the bag to the kale that's been sitting in the pan for a while. it sat on my never cleared table the whole dining experience because it is cooked so badly nobody could get to anything on the salad bar because they are chipping at ice while the salads are being blocked by their bodies. very unorganized & poorly planned. i went to culinary school & have worked in fine dining, this was a hug no no.
the outside tables were changed to these horribly uncomfortable low seating tables we had to croutch over to eat. our server took at least 10 - 15 mins to get us water & beer & i had to hunt down somebody to get utensils for what salad/hot food we could get to. the meat cutter rodezio meat cutters were non existent in the patio seating, the potatoes are very yummy but by the time you got meat they were cold. the meat was so bloody we were surprised it wasn't mooing. i don't mean that it was medium-rare or rare. it was a culinary term called blue-rare. the garlic-parmesian steak was so mushy, it was inedible. 
i would tell the meat cutters that the meat was too red, only 1 brought me back not bloody meat, the other's were like ""ok, no want meat"" the server went to the kitchen to get us more done meat, he brought back 2 types. one was cooked great, the other was cut thin but still total red inside (high flame, really fast). since we were on the patio we also didn't get all the meats offered to us that the people sitting inside were offered.. we do not like the seafood addition at all. the cooks put all of the seafood on the same broiler plate which causes every thing, shrimp, scallops, i think they offer swordfish or halibut .. it all tastes like salmon. salmon is strong, shrimp & scallops are delicate & should not be cooked with salmon thus everything tasting like salmon we didn't order this addition & do not recommend it.
we were not the only people on the patio complaining about the absence of meat cutters. hey pampa's hire a couple more per shift!!!
we had to ask 2 different people 3 times if we could get more water, upon my 3rd request i wasn't nice anymore & did mention that this was the 3rd time requesting water ... they do charge for water...fine but get us a refill on our 1st request, took us about 30+ minutes to finally get a water refill. in my opinion having to ask for a water refill is a sign of a bad server.
then let's get to our bill... it took at least 20 minutes of sitting with our dirty, never cleared plates waiting at our super uncomfortable table & chairs to get just the bill, i mentioned that we just want our bill because we are very uncomfortable at these horrible tables/chairs & would like to leave. another 20mins to get our credit card back. during this time we do not have any water & are very thirsty. 
now, we will return because a visiting family member has a gift card for here... however, the next time wile not sit on the patio at uncleared tables & uncomfortable tables/chairs. (pampa's.. who's stupid idea was it to use these chairs & tables?) we'll be inside, where the chairs & tables are more comfortable, the meat cutters actually come around more frequently inside & we can have a view of when the kitchen staff is finally finished overhauling the whole salad bar at once. we will also request our bill 30 minutes in advance of our wanting to leave & request a few extra waters to begin with. hopefully we'll have a server who removed dirty plates full of improperly sauteed kale. this was a bad experience, hopefully pampa's returns to their former selves.",1,0,0.999828995809456

the food was amazing and there's no complaints about the service. but i personally didn't like the the layout of the place.

1. they stuck us in the far back corner of the room, which i was ok with at first since  we had a 15 month old with us, but when the meat guys (not sure what they're called) systematically avoided our table, that was strike 1 for us...
2. ok, so the meat guys finally made it to our table, but guess which one kept coming to our table again and again. the lamb guy. i mean, really. if we wanted lamb we would have gone to a mediterranean restaurant or something. i mean, bring on the skirt steak and top sirloin. enough with the lamb. 
3. except they didn't have any skirt steak. they did have something they called filet mignon, but to be honest, i've never had filet mignon that tasted like beef jerky. 
4. but the real deal breaker for us...i mean the one that almost made us dine and dash, was their pan de quejio, if that's even what it was. they tasted more like dry biscuits from a fried chicken shop than those delightful little bursts of warm cheesiness we were anticipating. pampas, we can forgive you for the filet mignon. we'll even forgive you for ignoring us. but when you mess with the pan de quejio, that's when you've crossed the line. f-!!",1,0,0.9189239659885537

groupon also came with a side of seafood- the fish had good flavor and was well-cooked, shrimp was also very good, mussels were unfortunately a little fishy for my taste.

we got there and i showed her my paid for groupon- and let me tell you; for lunch it still costs $60 for the groupon plus tax and tip so you're still paying $75 for lunch. they brought us one small plate of seafood and that's it. the appetizers on the bar were pretty good except for their being so much cranberry in the dishes- this isn't necessary in every cold dish you prepare.
sometimes simpler is better:)

the meats they brought out were basically the same- sirloin and chuck; which were very good but lunch doesn't offer as much variety as i felt. also, they barely came around to your table. our server seemed like a nice lady but i saw a change in her presence after we mentioned our groupon- i think mainly because many people who have vouchers do not tip their servers well. so, we barely saw her come around to our table- we did notice though there was a lack of servers for lunch and so i felt kinda sorry for her. 
however, that being said...she still should have had a better attitude towards us even though we were groupon customers. we still left a tip- because both of us always believe you tip your servers; unless it's outright horrible service- most of them make minimum wage. always tip!!

9aCCWs_fVHY5nLpzLZ0SWw,2016,"this review is based on a dinner-show package that we purchased online. i will be reviewing the restaurant portion only on this site. 

as a first-time visitor to las vegas, we looked forward to our one and only show to which we bought a dinner package. at the box office check-in, we were given the option of three restaurants and we proceed to select pampas brazilian churrascaria (should have picked the burgers!).

at first, the restaurant seemed ""nice"" even though is located inside a strip mall. we were immediately sat down at our table and we turned down the ""upgrade"" to the meal as we had already paid for our dinner in advance. as part of the dinner package, we had the option of chicken, fish or beef and unlimited salad bar. this being a steakhouse, we obviously picked the beef.  

this is my third visit to a brazilian steak house and it was the worst one of the three. the salad bar selection was very limited and the hot food sides were barely hot and some items were as hard as stone. nevertheless, we filled up on whatever ""fresh"" items they had as we eagerly awaited our beef. upon arrival of our entree, we noticed the minute and insignificant amount of dry and tasteless beef along with a very small portion of dry mashed potatoes next to it. 

we proceed to fill up on the brazilian cheese bread (more like stones) and to make the best of a lousy meal. a frozen dinner beef patty will definitely taste better and be a larger portion. the red wine we had was atrocious and drank it because there was no place to spit it out. had we upgraded our meals by $13.00 each would it have made a difference? i honestly do not know and don't care to find out as any restaurant who serves this kind of food is not worthy of a second visit. the service was above average and the bathrooms were clean but i will never eat here again.

7mKhFykjqNZ58ckV_a0q9g,2012,"my rating is based primarily on the food, because if i gave service equal weight, i would halve the stars. since i tend to think with my stomach, i can overlook the service in this instance and direct my rating toward the food. the meat, as well as the salad bar, was great. i stuffed myself like i was living my last day on this earth. the meat came at decent time intervals. i especially jumped at the chicken, bacon-wrapped turkey, and sausage. 

my server, however, was quite cold and rude. she flinched when we mentioned that we had the tix4tonight voucher, taking away our menus immediately (what if i had wanted to browse it further?). instead of giving us tap water, which she did for the adjacent table, she handed us an acqua panna bottle ($6.95). two weeks later, i am still perplexed as to why this happened (i clearly did not say bottled water). she also consistently failed to check up on us, bypassing us as she checked on her other tables. i sometimes wonder why such people decide to go into the hospitality service. needless to say, her tip was accordingly small.

qUCeYaYpIKvoi53ox5RZMg,2011,"i am due to be married next year and my fiance and i saw this place on our chapels website as a reception option, so prior to us going to vegas, i looked at the review on here and saw that they were avg 3. i was hesitant about trying it but after getting to vegas my fiance and i quickly noticed that you can get awesome deal through tix4tonight booths located up and down the strip, since we were able to get a good coupon (pretty much by1 get1 free), the coupon cuts the price down by 1/2 (orig-$43/cupon $25)

mind you when we got the tickets the people said that it was a most awesome place to eat and sundays were to do it since their volume is minimal. so we made a reservation for 5pm and promptly were seated when we arrived 15 min early. the waitress we had was such a sweetheart she told us how our coupon worked and what we were in for 11 different meats! there is a yes/no indicator on ur desk so when the dervers come around with the meat they can see wether or not u want some or not. so we went to the salad bar, im pretty picky when it comes to some things so although there was much variety some things were intresting...to say the least althought the fried bannanas were delish! and the sauted carrotsmmm! 

after we got back to our desks the first person came around with sausage and turkey wrapped in bacon, the bacon was a little salty but good none the less. after that was lamb, i recommend it with the sauce its like a vinagrette delish! after that was tenderloin, roast beef, fliet minon(sp?) one thing i didnt like was the fact that we didnt get the chicken to the very end, they came around 2-3 times with same meat options and we would say no cause we were waiting for the chicken, so finally when we were almost to our limit here came the chicken and it was magnificent! it was like a spicy and you get a whole breast piece. so after we ate, we counted back and noticed we werent offered al the meats but oh well what are you gonna do, gotta leave some for next time i suppose. but i recommend this place just go get a discounted ticket first! its worth it!

DnqGEphVEeJ6cPZnXGg8Ag,2017,"the worst restaurant experience ever. after eating from the salad bar i started feeling queezy. (i'm 7 months pregnant so didn't think much of it) so i tried to eat the meat they bring around and couldn't eat much. during the middle of the night i woke up to the worse abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. (as well as my poor 2 year old son). we ended up in urgent care and the doctor told us it was more than likely food poisoning. all we had that day was cereal and pb and j sandwiches to work up an appetite for pampas.

i contacted the manger mike at pampas the next day and explained to him what happened. he said he would look into it and give me a call in the morning. he never returned my call, so i called him around 3 pm to see what happened. he acted like he had no idea who i was so explained everything again and made it seem like i was lying. i asked him if i took him my discharge paper work from the urgent care with the diagnosis if he could at least  refund my meal which cost $50 and he said no. so i was out $50 plus my dr visit copays and the copays for our prescriptions. i didn't even get an apology from this man! 

we loved going to pampas and every time we were in vegas it was a must! now i'm so disappointed in the customer service that we will not be going back. being pregnant and a 2 year old child makes you more susceptible to food borne illnesses and unfortunately i had the worst experience of my life here and they didn't care. highly disappointed.",1,0,0.9999756047042012
TRyufJM-tUIuL_GqG9jB_g,2009,"wow!  this is my first time eating at a brazilian restaurant.  the experience was amazing and the father's day gift certificate ($40 off through the month of june) was the icing on the cake.
pamas churrascaria is tucked into the south end of the planet hollywood shops.  if you go in the correct door, it is immediately on the left - otherwise you get to wander through the maze of 170 shops looking for it.
we had reservations (highly recommended) and still waited for about 10 minutes to get a table (not too bad).  the host was very good but spoke a little too fast for this novice to catch everything he was saying.
one of the managers (michele r.) came by while we were waiting on our drinks and talked with us about pampas and what we could expect.  from my questions, she offered us a tour of the kitchen and then took our picture in front of the grill.  this was a very nice touch and certainly helped me to understand what to expect from the overall experience.  she also made herself available to us throughout the night - checking back to make sure everything was just right for us.
michelle (our server) is from chicago and has the great chicago accent.  she is friendly, knowledgeable and fun to talk with.  service could have been a little faster for my taste but at 7:15 on a saturday evening with a wedding party on board, it gets a little bit crazy around there.
the food is amazing - 10 different kinds of meats, all freshly carved and served at your table.  the all-you-can-eat seafood was freshly prepared and very good but i was already getting full from the all-you-can-eat meat and salad and side bar by the time it arrived.
the desert tray looked fantastic but since i cannot have sugar, i asked about some strawberries.  michele r. came to my rescue (again).  the rest of my table enjoyed the chocolate mousse.

6rDO-vC2q9ZXO00Zcgbn_g,2013,"my husband bought an amazon locals deal for this restaurant for our 2nd anniversary.  we've been talking about doing a ""brazilian meat place"" for a while, so when he saw the coupons, he jumped on them.  
i made a reservation for 7 for the two of us.
we were running a bit late because of strip traffic, and got to the hostess stand at 6:59, she said we were checked in, and had to wait 15 minutes.  
my husband then ran to the restroom, and i waited in the most crowed lobby i've ever been in.
he wasn't back by the time they sat me, so i went a lone to the smallest table in the smallest corner of outside of the restaurant!  you're kidding me right?  you're seriously sitting me in the hallway of the hotel/casino?!  i was livid.  but let it go, it's supposed to be our speical night. our waiter came over and immediately asked if we had any coupons (tacky much?) but yes, i had coupons!  (it's tacky, i know, but we thought we had a good deal).  the almost unintelligible waiter informed us that the coupon only gave us access to the salad bar.......urge to kill, rising. 
 at that point i lost it.  ""this isn't what i was expecting"", i need another table.  
he went to go talk to the hostess to get us another table, in the meantime, another almost unintelligible girl came up with a huge cart of ""house drinks"" gave some bs about them, and just about forced you to buy it. ""no thank you"" your sure?!! ""yes!""

+ for the waiter being on his game tho, and getting us another table inside the restaurant, and even better right by the salad bar. 
let me try to get something across, there is no room to move in that place whatsoever.  you bump into people everywhere, the tables and chairs are packed so tight you have to shimmy behind them.  could you imagine carrying a tray of salad over 100ft back to your table?!  not this girl.

anyway, so we're inside now, got a new waiter, who was amazing, i'm ashamed i didn't get his name.  he was shorter, bald and had an aussie or new zealand accent, if you read this, thank you sir, you made our night.
but anyway, with new waiter, we showed him the coupons, and he let us know that yes, we get the salad bar and we get an hour of open bar (well drinks, draft beer, house red and white wine). ohhh, ok, that's cool.  and if we would like to partake in the meat, it's $20 more a person.  well yeah!  we're at a better table, i feel like i'm in the restaurant, we came here for that, so yeah, bring on the meat!
so with two blue moons on the way, i go up to the salad bar.  i saw mozzarella balls with balsamic vinegar and just loaded up on them.  they are my favorite.  grabbed some tomatoes, and extra vinegar.  grabbed some of the italian pasta salad, and a few containers of their cimichurry (sp?) sauces (for the meat i was assuming).  i love condiments.
my husband had flipped his card to green, then went up to the bar as well.  almost immediately, they came over with the meat.  alex (also my son's name) had some chicken wrapped in bacon, and sausage.  i didn't know how it worked with the portions, so i got one of each for me, and my husband.  i was still eating my mozzarella while the meat was piling up on my plate.  i had flipped my card to red because i wanted to take my time, relax and go at a slow pace to the onslaught of meat i knew was coming.  not my husband, he downed his salad, then started cleaning his plate of meat while mine piled higher and higher.  even tho i had a red card, they would still ask me if i wanted the meat.  i had my mouth full, and kept having to say no.  but wow that sausage was good.  the chicken was very dry, the pork was tasty, and the other meats faded into each other as piece after piece was dropped on my plate.  i remember lamb, tri tip, ham, even some roasted pineapple and oh yeah, the sausage!  i was stuffed...and we still had 30 mins on our open bar.  my hubby got 2 more beers, and i nursed my first one all night.  
even after everything that went wrong, the service of the new waiter saved the night, and the food was tasty enough to make us want to go back, like today, but it's so pricey!  we got a credit for the coupons we had, and the $40 we spent that night, the bill came to $130, but we only had to pay the $40.  we tipped the waiter on the $130, as you should, and he seemed to be appreciative of that.  so that made us happy.
it stared out horrible, and i wanted to walk out, but we had those coupons, and it was our anniversary...so i waited it out, and it tuned out great.  but there is nothing relaxing or calm about that place.  when and if you go, just remember that it's a very hectic atmosphere...maybe you'll be in a better mindset then i was.",3,0,0.6980163492434326

5RNtxZrYwiRbeu4okyznIQ,2017,"having stayed in vegas for a week already, we've eaten out a lot. which is why i'm really saying something when i say that this was probably the worst dining experience we've had while we were here. 

first of all, i was really insulted when a big, beautiful glass bottle of water was brought to our table, only for me to discover that it was most definitely tap water and the bottle had been refilled. 

my husband and i ordered sandwiches, his steak and mine veggie, each with a caesar salad. we also ordered the loaded fries to split. our order took much longer than i would have expected a couple of sandwiches to take, and when it got to our table we were semi-disappointed. the salads were incredibly wilted (but not warm), meaning they were dressed either that morning or more likely the night before. surprisingly, the sandwiches were pretty good. my veggie sandwich was delicious... but the menu said it would contain portobello mushroom. i've never seen portobello mushrooms that small or that similar looking to regular button mushrooms (if you catch my drift). if i can give this restaurant any tip, it would be to at least cut their fake portobello mushrooms because when they are whole, they shoot out of the sandwich and you end up eating them off of the plate with the fork. 

what really upset me was that when someone (not our server) brought us our food, we mentioned to him that we also had fries coming. he didn't understand us and therefore didn't check the kitchen, so no one knew that they never dropped our fries. eventually the waitress came to check on us, we mentioned the fries, and she put the order in (it was apparent that she hadn't in the first place). they took another 15 minutes, in total we waited about 45 minutes just for them to bring us fries that ended up being not very good (they were crinkle cut-- i expected something more sophisticated or at least well seasoned), and instead of chives, they put parsley on them.

while the salad was the kitchen's fault entirely, i blame the rest of the frustration with the meal on our server. it was clear she wasn't very good at multi tasking or checking on her tables... or putting an order in right in the first place.",2,0,0.9880789668651818

our waiter was very informative when we told him this was our first time. he suggested a few things and still told us what the best deal would be. the salad bar area was amazing. it had more than enough options for us. the meats kept coming ... up until the medium rare. when i mentioned to one of the managers (because he happened to ask me how the night was going) he personally had the guys serving the meat come to our table first. i was so impressed. i also asked the same manager for a personal side of hot green beans. i saw it pass me on a plate and didn't see it at the salad bar area. so when i asked him he was more than happy to give me a side of the hot green beans. his name is kyle and he knew how satisfied i was with their service and the dinner.

8eLL4wHxRl6MMciMXpebhg,2019,"to start off, if you were given a coupon/voucher from an associate in the strip, please do not go to pampas. i can explain why below:

service: 3/5
side dish/salad area: 2/5
meats/entrees: 1/5 (very salty)
worth it? no

my boyfriend and i were given so many vouchers for pampas our first day in vegas. what really catches your attention about the voucher is the ""brazilian steakhouse"" part. so, we were expecting a fogo de chao type experience, boy was i wrong. i should have knew something was up from all the vouchers being passed around. 

the voucher allows you and another person to get your total meal for $54.99 (this is the price of the rodizio dinner). the voucher is misleading as it says bogo dinner, which it in fact is, but in order for this voucher to be valid you must purchase the ayce shrimp for $20 ad well. so instead of the $54.99 total for two you thought you were paying, you're now paying around $75.90 for shrimp charge. you can opt out of the shrimp, but that would make your coupon invalid because you are not purchasing the steak and shrimp combo. 

upon being seated, we noticed that they were playing trap latin music like bad bunny on their speakers. i am not saying i dislike their music choice, but based on all the elderly and families present, they could have chose music that would better suit their audience. we waited about 15 minutes for our waiter who was super busy walking around and taking to all his tables. during this time, it might just be me whenever i go out to eat, but the tongs, glasses, and silverware they had our for us to use we're dirty. you could still see the good particles on the ware like it was rinsed quickly and not washed. 

after our waiter told us about how the coupon works we did not really care much because we were still in the mindset of a ""fogo de chao"" experience.. we thought wrong. they had a very minimal side dish/salad area. some of the side dishes (pasta, cheese bread, plantains) looked like they had been sitting there for a while. one good side dish i enjoyed was the crab salad. 

now, the meats were something on  a lower level. it seemed that the chef only sent out the same meats with all servers each 10 minutes. we were so excited to try the top sirloin, thinking of the ""fogo de chao"" experience, and it was so terrible. the meat was so, so, so salty. it was like the chef grabbed a ton of salt and slapped it all over the meat before serving. in addition to the salty meat, the meat was completely raw. don't get me wrong, i'm a medium-rare kinda guy, but the meat was so raw the blood kept oozing out everywhere on the plate. some other things i noticed was how they had some weird choices of meat/entrees to serve, for example: parmesan filet mignon and whole pineapples. 

the shrimp was very minimal for the $20 up charge. i got a small plate about a little larger than my palm. the shrimp had skin on and head some type of all meats/seafood seasoning. shrimp was bland and tasted over cooked. obviously, not worth $20 for the shrimp at all.   

after ingesting all of that salt, and barely eating to note, i was just ready go back to the room and sleep. our waiter was super busy, it looked like he was waiting the whole half of the restaurant. by the time he came back and offered us dessert, he said he would come back with the receipt. in this, he was quickly restating the meal we had and quietly and quickly stated there was a $2 charge for water!!! i have never been to a restaurant where hey charged for water! nonetheless, tap water! i felt bad for the waiter in the end, he tried to liven up the atmosphere after reading our faces of discontent from this experience. please, save yourself the money and go to fogo if you are craving a real brazilian steakhouse experience.",1,0,0.9958645458536654

tFrPHB2wde9ZKpLlKGANag,2015,"my husband and i rarely go out, but family was in town so we had babysitting available. normally, we go to another brazilian steakhouse in town, but a friend encouraged us to look at groupon and this restaurant has seafood included in their line-up of meats. my husband is a big seafood lover so we decided to try it out. we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation as we misjudged traffic on the freeway and didn't realize how much walking we'd have to do to get to the restaurant past all the shops. we were told we'd be seated in a few minutes, but it took about 35 minutes. it was busy and it looked like quite a few people were complaining about the wait. our assumption is that even if we'd been on time for our reservation, we would not have been seated on time. 

some seating was in the front of the restaurant so those people had to maneuver through all the people standing to get to the food bar, which contains side items and salad items. thank goodness we were not seated in the front.  tables were mostly pushed close together so they could pack as many as they could into the restaurant.  in other words, you got an intimate look at the wait staff's rear ends about 12 inches from your plate when ever they were waiting on tables next to you.  that is a turn-off. to go back and forth to the food bar, you have to maneuver between tables, hopefully when someone isn't coming up the aisle at the same time. once a male waiter started at the same time i was going the other direction.  instead of being gentlemanly and letting me go first, he shoved through first.  i found that rather rude, especially since i was also a customer.

the men carrying the meat throughout the restaurant did not stop at every table. in fact, a lot of the meat we didn't even see until we were finished.  they didn't go table to table. they'd wander around and completely zip past us, without even slowing down. therefore, i'm sure we didn't even try some of the meats. the quality of the meat was very poor. most of the beef was extremely chewy or gristly. a lot of it, i just left on my plate as i found it inedible.  we buy all of our steaks at costco and let's just say that the costco steak that we prep at home is far superior to the discount gristly meat they prepared.  for the seafood, they brought a plate and refilled as necessary. the salmon was good and had some type of teriyaki sauce. there was a white fish, maybe tilapia, that was so-so.  it tasted like something i'd prep at home and i can't cook fish.  the shrimp was disappointing as that is my favorite since i am not a seafood fan. well, it was cooked, but not peeled. it really cut down on how much we ate as it was too big of an annoyance to peel each one.

the only value of the groupon was that it included 2 cocktails, which my husband and i don't find necessary and 1 dessert to share, which we frequently don't get anyway  the seafood was supposed to be the added value, but it wasn't anything special and i would not return based on their seafood.

the salad / food bar was tasty and i have no complaints there. our waitress was awesome and we tipped accordingly.

we will not be returning to this restaurant as it really had a discount, low budget restaurant feel. .we were packed in like sardines and the meat quality was like something from ihop.  this is not acceptable when you're paying about $50 per plate.  on our next date night, we will be going back to our other brazilian steakhouse which costs the same, but they do not offer discounts.  i prefer to pay full price for quality, flavorful meats with top-notch wait staff.",1,0,0.997016021598391

the staff with the meat do come by very often and for the surf, we each got a piece of scallop, shark, salmon, and shrimp.  the shark tasted...odd.  i am not a fan.

our favorite item is the cheese bread pão de queijo.  the third time i came back to get another 4 pieces, there was none left.  i asked one of the kitchen staff to bring out more since the basket is empty and 5 minutes later, he gave me a plate of fresh hot pão de queijo...he is the awesome-est person there.

 for the pão de queijo.
 for the awesome staff.

the server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. it was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. i was happy i did not order the  buffet.

we were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. it would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. when the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. the filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. the skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. the bouillabaisse  passed the palate test. 

will i return? no. the  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. the second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after i apologized for recommending pampas. i also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of servers with meats for those who chose the rodizio.",1,0,0.9982377355179256

4VyVhluni_QXHlfB2fX8Jg,2014,"we go to pampas in planet hollywood miracle mile area often, we recommend it to friends coming in to las vegas. in act i even suggested my friend use pampas for her reception dinner after her wedding dinner coming up this spring (probably 40ppl). 
  pampas has high quality food (wish they'd stop pre-dressing the caesar salad though) & good quality meats. when i brought friends from mi here this past feb we really enjoyed the fun made to order drinks that the lady makes at her cart-going table to table (fyi-2 of the ladies that work there are past olympian's in volleyball). 
  we always get great service & very pleasant ... not the case today... from the get go our server ""kelly"" was rude. she spoke to me in a very condescending tone... kinda like she was annoyed with me. i am one of those people who doesn't like bloody meat. i had asked 3 different rodizio's if i could get some cooked a little more. typically this is no problem. i was sitting & waiting & sitting &  waiting (probably 20mins) while everyone else got their mid rare meats. i finally saw the server again & asked her i she could please check on this for me. instead she went off on me! i saw the people at the next table look over toward our way because of the tone she had used with me. ""well it takes more than a minute to cook it!"" spoke very sharply & loud. i am normally not a drinker & try to stay clear of sodas. kelly was good at refilling our water & taking away any dirty plates, this i will give her. but she is also very good at being rude to customers. yes, i had a coupon... i know a guy who's wife works there, she said ""everyone uses coupons there-not a big deal"" if the company didn't want people to use coupons then they wouldn't give them out. it is not kelly's place to judge me for having a coupon! actually i never mentioned the coupon. when our bill came it was for dinner price (we came while it was still lunch price but ran over into dinner) and it said wingate on it. i tried to get her attention but couldn't. as the mgr kate (who is awesome) came by i said ""i believe that i have someone elses  bill as it also had sodas on it"" all of the sudden kelly emerges & snapped at me that's how it's done when it's that coupon... i said ""but i don't have a wingate coupon"" her reply- a sharp ""yes you do, that's what you told me!!!!"" i had never mentioned any coupon at all to kelly. she walks away clearly irritated at me. i said to kate that this seriously is not  my bill. it actually would have been cheaper but i'm not trying to rip anyone off. kate took it to kelly... kelly redid it, again for dinner. i said to kate, we came at lunch time. kate said she would take care of it. this time kelly pretty much slams it down in front of me & it now it the same dinner bill but with 3 copies. she walks away without saying a work-her attitude said a lot though. i then go to nelly the awesome hostess who sat us with the bill. she said ""oh no, you 2 were definitely here before dinner started"" then kelly says to me, once again rude as can be... ""i was told by the manager to make it for dinner!!!!!"" which i know was a lie. i did get it fixed to lunch. we tipped on the total bill before the discount. we tipped on the bank card so she would be forced to give the rodezios their share & we tipped about 18%-20% on the pre-discount price. i understand that the meat rodezios might have forgot me. but the attitude & rudeness that i received from kelly was uncalled for.  
  i will go again, i will continue to tell friends about pampas, i hope that my friend does have her after wedding dinner at pampas. i will just make certain to request not to have kelly as my server & i will tell my friends to request not to have her as well. 
  i definitely recommend this place, it is yummy & actually a good price for being on the strip. they have coupons & deals online, thru out the casino, on groupon, on restaurant.com. the people who run it realize that it's cheaper to do coupons than it is to pay for commercial time. 
  so my advice to anyone reading this.. go to pampas, enjoy it, it's great there but request to not have kelly as your server. you want to enjoy your meal experience... a brazilian steak house is an experience. just don't have kelly  as your server or your experience will be ruined! and by the way, it was steady there but not so packed that kelly was over burdened. i have worked in restaurants in my life (i even went to culinary school) there was no reason for her nastiness!",4,0,0.9724856788274465

having been in the restaurant industry for many years, i can see through the bs that most customers on here have complained about.  it seems as though the restaurant has coupons all over the place, which doesn't always bring in the nicest of clientele.  the more discounts and coupons offered, the more picky and complaining guests you are going to have.  the table next to us complained about something and the manager comped their entire meal!  from what i observed, nothing was that bad.  that is not how to get repeat, quality customers.  apologize, fix the error, buy them a round, but for the sake of the server, don't give away the house.  

the best part of our dinner was our server.  having grown up in wa, jessica and ourselves had a lot to talk about. seahawks, mariners, the crappy rain in seattle, awesome concerts at the gorge, you name it.  it is always nice to run into someone who is where you are from when traveling.

so, we also had the ""dreaded"" coupon that other reviewers had mentioned previously.  at face value, it's a pretty good deal - lunch for $21 per person, all you can eat.  the problem, as mentioned by other posters, are the additional ""fees"" they add on as part of the coupon deal.  first off, water is poured before even asking, which is normally normal, but not in this case.  every person is charged a $1 water filter (yes filter) fee.  obviously, a minimal charge, but a charge nonetheless.  second, everyone had to order a drink as part of the discounted lunch.  we decided to get two pitchers, which counted, as well.  we got a pitcher of an ipa and a pitcher of sangria - shame on us for not checking the price.  $35 for one, $36 for the other - ridiculous.  i was thinking maybe $20-25, but this was over the top.  plus, the sangria pitcher was at least half full of ice and really not very good.

on to the food.  we really liked the salad bar and the choices there.  my daughter and i really loved the sauteed mushrooms.  but really, plenty of choices for everyone.  on the meats, the sirloin and pork loin were our favorites, really tasty, tender, and well cooked.  the bacon wrapped chicken and grilled pineapple were both pretty good too.  the ham was too salty for me, and the tri-tip and chicken legs were over cooked and dried out.  overall, we were very happy with the meal.  definitely come with a big appetite, because it's all about eating quantity here!

the service was fine.  our server was mostly attentive, although we had to ask for water refills several times.  again, the biggest negative was the cost of drinks.  if it wasn't for that, i would say four stars.",3,1,0.30463689639347025

they don't keep a close eye on you here.  i was eating the extra meat from my friends extra plate the entire time waiting for my chicken.  by the time it arrived, i was full!  i should've not used the coupon and ordered an appetizer and snacked on the filet mignon coming around all night!

what most annoyed me was how people would come around with cameras asking to take a complimentary picture (which was not complimentary they give you a tiny wallet sized picture and try to upswell you a bigger one for $20) would pester us while we were eating twice! right when we got our food this lady comes up and rudely interrupts our eating and almost demands that we take a picture because it was ""free"". it was just aggravating that while you're eating a nice dinner with your family you're being badgered by people. people were also walking by constantly through the tables trying to advertise their meat on the sticks which was also mildly annoying.

wG4IBrQzisJOP4lVKT4Ttw,2012,"i made a bad mistake today, i let the wife decide where we were going for dinner. she picked a brazilian steakhouse.

now i actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...and way over priced....

i love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it americans) in garlic and i would be happy.

so i am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...but i let the wife pick dinner...

so, after a quick ""no"", ""but you said i could pick"" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost...

ok meat plus a meal i had already payed for..works for me.

service was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come...

but it's the food you want to know about....well frankly, the meal was ""free""...and i think we were charged to much.

the meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless.

the one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...i had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good.

GwkgGBSNJl1ooDyeff69sg,2015,"since the kids are on spring break at grandma's this week, me and the husband are also on spring break. and although we have to work during our spring break, we decided, to do something completely different and fun for our tuesday night dinner, something we can't ever do with the kids. we became tourists in our own town with dinner and a show. we scored 8:30 pm tickets to zombie burlesque through vegas.com which offered dinner at either pampas churrascaria or the italian restaurant across from the v theater where the show would be. i went on yelp beforehand of course, and read the unimpressive reviews of pampas. we briefly considered the italian place, but because we're living dangerously and hadn't done brazilian in a long time, we thought we would give it a try, yelp reviews be damned. 

well the rating lived up to its hype, or rather non-hype. for us, we believe the worst part was the pokey service. when we finally did get a server to acknowledge us, we then had to go over the fine print of what the show tickets included in terms of the dinner. we would only get a choice of an entrée: beef, chicken or fish which came with run of the mill sides. and the only alcohol included was the sangria, house beer, and their cocktail concoction, which i can't remember what it's called, but, looked completely labor intensive for the gal making it. we upgraded to the buffet for $10 more and the $20 per person alcohol ticket for an hour of well drinks. fuck it! we're on spring break. 

the buffet was decent. it offered an array of cheese, veggies and other sides. the meat merry-go-round was just okay. the tri-tip piece that i had was dry, which made it difficult for me to cut into. my husband appeared to have received a juicer piece of tri and he still had issues cutting the meat. his contribution to this review is simply: this place needs sharper knives to cut the meat.

so yeah, i got nothing else. this place is just adequate and tailored to the tourists. if you're in vegas as a tourist, you don't generally come for the food. you come to gamble, see the shows and drink yourself stupid. if you're looking for a really good brazilian place, this place isn't it. but if you're looking for a last minute dinner and show, this will do okay.",2,0,0.958968767395346

K14aBaNazBxh295Gxv6T4w,2017,"i was very excited to go here for thanksgiving dinner.  the price was fantastic for a brazilian grill - $30 and included the normal experience plus turkey, dressing and the trimmings.

we had an 11:30am reservation and were the second group seated for lunch.  we were seated in a really cool private room that looked like a wine cellar with glass walls.  we discovered right away that even though the room appeared to be great, it was probably the worst place to sit in the whole restaurant.  we waited and waited for our server who never came.  one of our group stopped another server and asked them to find our server and send them over.  a manager heard the conversation and stepped in to help.  at this point we found out that the bartender was supposed to be our server - which did not work well as she was busy making the drinks for all the tables.  

once we gave our drink orders to the manager we went to get our salads.  upon return to the table our second issue started.  none of the 'carvers' were stopping to come into our room with any of the meats as they passed by.  we could see them walk by, but no one stopped.  when the manager returned to check on us we told her and she went to find them to send them over.  after that we got plenty of chicken and sausage, but still none of the other carved meats. 

eventually word got out that we were not being served and they started to come by, but by that time we were all getting full.  we had had salad and a couple of meat choices and then sat for a long while - so our tummy's were done for.

i purchased a lunch groupon for 65$ for two with the unlimited surf and turf + mimosas. 

when walked in, there was a 5-10 min wait. no biggie. we were then seated in a crowded room with 2 servers. 

the busser that walked by us filled up all four glasses of water on the table when there was only 2 of us and didn't clear away the other place settings. annoying but i brushed it off.

i asked for our drinks from the server, busser, and finally a manager. 20 mins later we got our mimosas. 

the meats that came around were very rare in the middle, unlike last time when they were more well done. that knocked more points off for us, but for others that may be a plus. 

i repeatedly asked for the ""surf"" portion of our meal and we finally got it in the end after at least an hour.

it should be a warning signal but we were in lav for a vacation and don't want to ruin our evening so we wait patiently. 

after 30 min or so, we got a table. it was a busy night so we waited patiently for the waiter for a while and the manager shown up and shown us the menu and took our drink order. look like they were short on staffs or something but the service was terrible. during the entire time, we see our waiter once and the second time when we grapped him to get the check.

the food was a big disappointment. the salad is below average and you can get better salad at any other places a lot cheaper than the 25.00 they charged.the meat was so so, filet mignon a pretty chewy, lamp is undercooked, etc  we have eaten at fogo de chaos, and texas brazil so we think  the foods are definitely better there.

we have a groupon we bought for 50.00 and suppose to worth 100.00, but the waiter charged us an extra 25 for using groupon and gave us a 75.00 credit instead of 100.00 like on the groupon.

we purchased an amazon special for a buy 1 for the price of 2. not anywhere on the voucher did it say, meat not included. the buffet is only veggies and a salad bar, and that is $45 regular price. basically, what we got was the salad bar for half off, and free alcohol (only well drinks) for the first hour, not including the tax and gratuity.

little did we know that the meat was not included. that ended up being an extra $20 per person, plus tax and gratuity. don't get me wrong, the meat was amazing and the service was great! the issuse we had, especially me, was when i asked for the manager of the restaurant and the chef came out after we receive a bill for $360!

when i was approached by the (so called manager) he walked right up to me and said, ""what's the issue here""? not as any professional would approach a table and introduce him/herself and say their name and rank, also asking us the right questions and showing customer service the way i thought it would be.

he said, ""what is the issue""? as i began to tell him what the issue was and how my hole table is confussed as we had no idea and it was never indicated on the voucher, that the meat wasn't included and tax and gratuity isn't included, the hole time he had the facial expressions of, no matter what you say i will not help you, give you half off, listen to what you're saying, in fact i am going to argue with you and make this all your fault because you the customer of my restaurant that's never been here before is wrong and i am right! let's not forget the fact that it's my wife's 30th birthday and she is pregnant, as we're having a great time and here he comes and reined the damn birthday party!

complete douche bag, inconsiderate, false leading and no compassion or understanding of the customer or to even listen and try to work with me and understand that it's not the money, it's the fact that my friends and family didn't expect another larger bill, especially after the servers where coming around serving meat and drinks we all were tipping well over $100 plus not knowing another bill of $360 was coming.

never!!!!! will i return to this place. i am embarrassed that i was treated with such disrespect and my wife feels bad after receiving the bill and we had to pay $40 each extra as a group per couple. i would rather have gone to chuck e cheese and all of us adults acted like kids again instead of being treated like a piece of trash.

e9dqV7rRyJd-JCgsLWHXQw,2017,"came here with a groupon ($52 for all-you-can-eat surf 'n' turf and unlimited mimosas, sangria, or beer for two during lunch hours, which is before 4 pm) and we enjoyed the experience! my review is only about the groupon we used, since we did not order anything else. note: you have to pay for water + tax at the end, even if you didn't really drink water. not including tip, we probably paid about $60 after water and taxes, if i remember correctly. 

definitely come here hungry if you plan on doing this, since meat and drinks fill you up pretty quickly. 

here's how it works: once you're seated, you can start with the salad bar and order your drink. when that's done, different staff members will come around holding different cuts of meat, and you can choose whether or not you want to take it or wait for something else to come around. if you've ever been to a dim sum restaurant, it's a little like that except with meats instead of carts of dim sum, and of course everything was already paid for. once you're done eating meat, they bring you a dessert to share, and you pay and leave!

my least favorite thing was probably the salad bar. we pretty much had to choose from pre-made salads since they didn't have the individual salad toppings anywhere, just plain lettuce or things like cole slaw, potato salad, green bean salad, etc. however, they have a bunch of cheeses to choose from as well as some breads, chips, soups, and other miscellaneous items. lots of options!

get the white sangria! we tried that and the mimosas, but the white sangria was better in my opinion. 

the service here was the best. everyone was so nice and enthusiastic. 

some of the meats were great, and some were just okay. they give you this wooden cylinder with red on one end and green on the other. green side up = more meat, red side up = no more for now. we were gorging on meat for a little over an hour while we were there, and my favorite was the sirloin! so tender, medium-rare, and juicy. some of the pork we got was pretty dry, so i didn't get too much of that. 
they also had bacon-wrapped chicken, sausages, tri-tip, grilled pineapple, etc. 
the seafood dish they bring you has mussels on it as well as some shrimp and salmon, and you can ask for another if you finish the plate, since they won't be bringing it around like they do the meat. 

we had the flan for dessert and it was delicious! i'll be uploading a picture later.

servers were very attentive & the only reason i gave the ! also the salad bar was filled and kept watch over. yes it looked nice but taste was another story. beets had odd taste, mashed potatoes tasted like they had been reheated a few times & the chicken noodle soup was just awful... 

the sausage tasted like a breakfast link not any chorizo or other sausage i've had at rodizio at all. garlic steak had odd color and bland flavor, ham was ok at best & smelled way better than it tasted. honestly on the red meat aside from the garlic you couldn't tell one from the other. pineapple is usually my favorite palate cleanser & am used to cinnamon but this was just grilled and hard on outside not caramelized. in all i'm very glad this meal was a part of our tour & we weren't very hungry because it was our worst meal in vegas!

our server was extremely helpful when we said that we were never here before but explained that we were vegetarians so we may be ordering odd items. he took the time to explain the menu to us and went over options that would work for our dietary restrictions. we started with a beer and diet coke. for dinner i ordered salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables and my husband had linguine with mussels, shrimp, crab and a lobster tail. both meals came with their salad bar. to our surprise the salad bar had much more than just salad. they offered rice and potatoes, different types of quinoa and couscous salads and even fruit. all were extremely delicious. 

we were both extremely pleased with our dinners and my husband actually had half of my salmon because it was so delicious. i tried his lobster tail and some pasta and his was also great and he said that the entire meal was amazing and some of his favorite to date. we still had $5 left on the gift card which was pretty amazing since we had eaten so much food already so we had a chocolate mousse for desert which was more filling and large than i had anticipated. the service was amazing, the food was delicious and their salad bar was under rated. all prices were extremely reasonable- especially their prices for their steaks and the full brazilian steakhouse experience. i would definitely return if i came back to las vegas.",4,1,0.0012890811799253221

LkgqiRF3LaZCVQmDFC0AaA,2014,"when you walk into this place, your senses will be overwhelmed with meat. chicken, all cuts of beef, and a pineapple.  meat lovers should rejoice at this location.  should.  (more on that later) the wait was incredibly fast, but that's because we had reservations.

the atmosphere is fine. mood lighting throughout, unless you had ""outdoor"" seating, the restaurant is nicely setup.  they had a buffet tucked in the corner with hot foods and cold salads.  waiters walked everywhere carrying large slices of meat.

we order the two dishes, their salmon and rib eye.   i have to say their salmon sauce is amazing, it was sweet, tangy and a touch of sour. however, the salmon itself is crap. the meat itself was tasteless and dry.   its as if their supplier picked the lowest quality fish available and gave it this restaurant.   sure, pampas tried (and did a fine job of) masking the tasteless fish with a wonderful sauce.   but that farmed, previously frozen salmon meat is still crap.  
 
their rib eye was overcooked (and a tad crunchy)on the outside. but medium rare on the inside.  the menu may brag about their sea salt rubbed, seasoned beef.  i just taste salt.  as in, they may have overdid the salt.

the salad bar is a free-for-all. lots of people crowded in, with all kinds of options.  i don't know where the lines started, or ended.   (or maybe it was just our timing.)

 their soups was fine.  salads are, well, salads.  spinach, pastas, artichokes, asparagus.    the salad bar offers a good number of choices.   i really can't say bad things about their selection.  but then again, i can't say good things either.

hknPbC1o1N7fq57fE9Kczg,2018,"we visited pampas on thursday during lunchtime.  the  shows that we were dissatisfied with several things that just shouldn't happen in restaurants. 

first off, is the strange way seafood is brought to tables when one gets the groupon for 'surf and turf lunch with unlimited alcoholic drinks and a dessert option'. the server brought us a plate of mussels, shrimp, cocktail sauce, and fried or baked fish. i was not interested in neither the fried/baked fish nor the mussels. so, unfortunately, they were left on the plate and thrown out as wasted food. :( 

why dont the waiters just ask what customers would prefer? rather than assuming and bringing the seafood that will be in the trash within 30 minutes. why not bring me a small plate of shrimp, after asking what i wanted, and keep replenishing them as needed? 

secondly, the wait staff appeared very busy during lunch and strangely enough a random waitress came over to tell us we were in the the wrong table (after being sat there by the hostess), which was very confusing. we ended up staying at the table, but felt that that is not something to tell the customer - you talk to the staff who potentially made the error or look to correct the situation. after that comment she came back once again to say the same thing until our waiter and her had a conversation around us actually being in the correct table. 
 
third, the selection of food at the buffet area was pretty good and the meats were all tasty. but we didn't feel our waiter came by enough times to ask how we were doing or if we wanted refills on our alcoholic drinks.

overall, if we ever go back to vegas, we probably won't go back to pampas.",3,0,0.9991749813722915
qaRDe97GXsu9YEreoe8QGA,2012,"tried this place with a groupon, which ended up being a pretty decent deal. i can't say the same for paying full price here, but to each his own i suppose. i've been to a few different brazillian steakhouses so this was by no means a unique experience, but it was a mostly pleasant one.

the interior is fairly well decorated, and the location is convenient-- right in the middle of the m shops. great if you are planning on shopping afterwords, or if like me, you just like the atmosphere and are too cheap to shop at stores like these. the staff was accommodating and seated us without incident.

the salad items aren't bad but some are better than others. the tortellini is ok, the olives are tasty, the artichoke is a nice touch, but the garbanzo salad had a pretty weird flavor. it was just the end of happy hour so i was happy to have a stella artois for 3.50.

then of course there's the actual meat. the kobe fish was different and well seasoned but a bit dry. the shrimp didn't taste much different from any shrimp i've had elsewhere-- i honestly prefer the stuff you can get at cajun themed restaurants. 

there was some ""spicy chicken"" but it didn't seem particularly spicy to me-- although it was delicate and fell easily off the skewer. most of the meat servers are pretty friendly and will likely give you a double portion of meat if you let them know you really like what they're serving. the lamb was delicate and cooked to a perfect medium rare. it came with a sweet and tangy balsamic sauce that complimented it well. the garlic sirloin was solid, but the seasoned sirloin came out pretty dry and appeared to have been cooked well done. the tri-tip was delectably juicy ( i happen to be a huge fan of tri-tip) but the top sirloin was rather dry. 

when the bill came and it was obvious how much we had saved with the groupon, we had no gripes. however, i don't think i would have been as pleased if we had paid full price for the food. the quality of the cuts seems up to par but too many of their offerings were overcooked, and i just wasn't that blown away by the quality here. this place is no fogo de chao, but if you have a groupon or other discount deal, it's not a waste of your time to try them out. you'll be stuffed and fairly satisfied with what you get.",3,1,0.11484487920255537

Ig9dbLgy-7VL8o8_YOOihg,2011,"so my boyfriend lawrence t., and by boyfriend, i mean my best friend's roommate that i jokingly call my ""fake boyfriend,"" took me and my best friend, jen s., out to dinner here last night, 3/13/11. he said, ""i just want to take you girls out for a nice dinner."" awww!

wow, so i was stuffed from eating at the mint cmye earlier that morning. lawrence said to get whatever, but i was a bit uneasy looking at the prices. it's not cheap - the salad bar alone is about $25! he said not to worry because it was on him. i ordered the taquitos ($9) but our waiter, andreas, told me they ran out of chicken, so i ordered the salad bar. 

jen ordered chicken satay as an appetizer ($9.) a bunch of skewers came stuck in a half a lemon with a little plastic container of peanut sauce. i could imagine chef gordon ramsay throwing a fit over the presentation - i'd skip the lemon slice and just lay the skewers on the plate and put the peanut sauce in an actual (non-disposable) container. anyway...

lawrence ordered salmon and jen ordered chicken, which was a huge portion and was really juicy and tasty! ($30+/each) the waiter, andreas, said the entrees came with ""salad bar,"" caesar salad, or mashed potatoes. it's a bit confusing because those items are both on the salad bar - and no matter which of those three options you choose, you can still go to the salad bar. the menu needs to clear up that wording because it's confusing - just say all meals come with the salad bar. 

i have to say that the salad bar isn't really a ""salad bar"" if you're expecting something like sweet tomatoes. nope, it's more like pre-made pasta and seafood salads, various soups, bread and anti-pasta. the roasted red peppers, my favorite, were so delicious, as was the hearts of palm salad. the feta was nice and briny and went well with the artichokes. i'm not one for seafood, but the calamari salad was so good and the lamb stew was divine! the money spent is worth unlimited lamb stew for sure! i wasn't a fan of the feijoada, which was 99.9% just black beans, but the marinated mushrooms were scrumptious and i went back for thirds!

even with the groupon i wouldn't have paid $10 for the food i got there. if anyone knows what a good steak is, don't eat here. the sirloin was dry and extremely tough. the "" filet mignon"" was more like a ny strip with no flavor and very stringy. i choked the ham down and didn't dare to get any thing else. their salad bar was very sparse and wasn't very good. the drinks that were free were very selective and i ended up with a sangria which was alright but after 3 i didn't even have the slightest buzz. at a past brazilian buffett the pineapple was my favorite, this pineapple i wouldn't even eat. everything was dried out and flavorless or had the wrong flavors.

our server nicole was very polite and we asked her for a recommendation as we had never been to this type of brazilian grille before. nicole gave us a great description of the way they work and suggested we try the surf & turf ""rodizio"". it's an all you can eat salad bar, with an endless supply of seafood and a variety of meats that they bring around to your table on these big skewers. the waiters actually carve off pieces for you right at your table so it's pretty entertaining too. there are a variety of skewered meats that include sirloin, pork loin, sausage and a bacon wrapped chicken that was amazing. my favorite was the skewered ham and the shaved pineapple. really tasty.

okay so it's a brazilian grille..the parade of meats is incredible but their salad bar totally rocks too! marinated artichokes, roasted peppers, sliced portabello mushrooms, pasta salad with olives and sliced salami, lamb stew, an assortment of rices, mashed potatoes, seasoned chicken, and tons of other soups and traditional salad bar items. my only suggestion is that you have to bring your a game appetite when you go to pampas because it is all so good.

you get seated in the table. we had a large group, so we got the side dishes they had. i got some rice, mashed potatoes, etc. i suggest not grabbing too many things, because the main course are the meats that are personally served to you.

**make sure the little card is facing correctly on your table is for service meat servers to serve you**

the servers go around with various meats, such as, pork loins, tri-tips, turkey bacon, sausages, etc. the servers will tell you what kind of me he is serving. you can say ""yeah i'll try"" or ""no thanks"". they would carve out a section of meat and tell you to grab it with your tongs. you can always ask for extra meat if you like it. they'll cut 1 or 2 more upon request. i really liked the pork loins. it was really good. i had to ask for other servers when the pork loin person is coming again, because i would like some more. some meats are pretty salty for my liking, esp the sausages.

when were were about to pay, it took 15 minutes of waiting in frustration. no one was able to take our card. our waiter didn't come back and when we told the other waiters, they just told us we have to ask our waiter. we could have walked out and now one knew or cared that we didn't pay. we waited, until my friend had to tell the manager that we were waiting 15 min for someone to take our card. the manager apologized and helped us. but that was the only problem we had. other than that, it was a neat experience to try.",3,1,0.4272123591370013

gjfOyPX0A_P2chQhJiwwZQ,2016,"this restaurant was fairly mediocre. nothing special enough to make me feel inclined to go again. the food was good, the service was bad. the prices would have been completely ludicrous if we had not purchased a ""travel zoo"" voucher. they charged a fee for water (which they brought without us requesting) and charged taxes on top of the voucher. every other groupon or voucher we used on our trip included the taxes so there was no surprises at the end of the meal. 

again, the food was good. however it was very standard brazilian food and nothing made it stand out as unique. the pineapple (which is always the highlight at a place like this!) was not done well and very disappointing. 

as far as service as service goes, this place was terrible. the waiter never returned to refill drinks (i paid for that water!) and they were very slow to remove used plates. the indicator you are supposed to use to let them know if you want more meat brought over was useless. when flipped to red we still had a heavy onslaught of people coming to the table. other times we waited 5-10 minutes before anyone came around. 

the biggest turn off here was the waiter. after not returning to our table for literally 35 minutes, never refilling our waters or asking if we wanted to purchase more sangria, not offering dessert options and leaving us waiting for a final bill for twenty minutes after we asked for it...he had the nerve to say ""please don't forget to tip based on the amount your meal would have cost without the voucher. people always forget that."" ummmmm....",3,0,0.9994993785532089

will start with the scam, have been to pampas a couple of years ago, it was great.  so recently a groupon came up for sale and i figured i'd buy it.  $100 for $50 in food, how could i go wrong?  well i found out.  pampas artificially inflates their retail prices and then offers discounts through various venues (ticket for tonight, groupon, people handing out flyers in the mall) to make people think they are getting a good deal.  so in the end you just end up paying about what you'd pay at any other restaurant....as long as you use your coupon (i feel for the poor people that don't utilize some sort of coupon at pampas). 

for example:
seafood buffet - $48
meat buffet - $44

in vegas you can find far better values for much less than that, or even splurge and eat somewhere higher end for about the same price.

so i guess with groupon i expect to get some sort of bargain or deal, and i felt like i didn't here.  so i feel like i've been taken advantage of.  thus i must rate this place as .

the food is really quite good.  the meat tastes delicious and the salad bar is quite good.  the service is ok, the waiter was actually the same guy for both visits.  he has a very thick accent and is somewhat difficult to understand, but he's very good at his job.  they didn't seem to have much of a clue when it came to helping us with our baby, so if you have a little one you may want to steer clear.",2,0,0.8504666987618067

our waiter told us there was the salad bar and what not in the back so we went back there surprised to find they were serving brunch items. mid through our meal they switched out the food slowly with the lunch foods (mashed potatos, plantains, mushrooms etc). now heres the crazy stuff. it took about 20 min for us to get the first serving of meat then after that, nothing! we then realized we didnt have that little stop go paper you normally get to let the servers know we want meat. we remedied that situation by swiping one from an empty table and signaled for meat. 

alas, 30 mins later hungry and sad we still didnt have meat. we brought this to our waitresses attention that meat wasn't coming our way and she said she'd let them know. slowly they start venturing out to our table with what seemed like meat but didnt taste very good. so we're thinking maybe the pineapple is good but no..  how does one go wrong with pineapple? you burn it. thats how.

8ITCfL7EE8R-CDG0fxMy_Q,2015,"came here this past weekend with a group of friends while enjoying vegas and i have to say this dinner outing did not go great. 

we had a group of 12 (understandably large but considering the setting it's not bad at all)  and they were able to squeeze us in without too much of a wait (this is the ). however once we were in and had all ordered which plates we would want, that's when things went down hill. 

our table seemed to become invisible when it came to the meats, we had about 2 guys come and slice everyone meat and then we had nothing for a good 15 minutes. i've been to other brazillian style churrascaria's where you literally have to turn them away with all the meat they're bringing to your table. we had to inform our waitress before we got maybe 2 more guys to come by. at one point someone in our party had to call out to a guy to come by and slice meat for us and he looked pretty upset to be bothered to serve us. our party was definitely bothered that they couldn't enjoy their meats like they hoped. 

actual quality of the meats was ok, not great. a lot of the meats that we did have served were definitely overcooked imo (i'm more of a medium rare kind of person), but what can you do i guess.

finally when it came time to split the bill, things went from bad to worse. i understand that splitting the bill can be tedious and time consuming, but the process of getting our bill and paying should not 30-40 minutes. some people got their checks first, others had to wait an additional 20 minutes before theirs came out and our waitress was no where to be found. we actually asked another employee to help us track her down for the missing checks so we could finish paying and he came back saying that it takes time to split bills for such a big group (aka our fault)

we took our friend this year, who does not eat red meat and overall it was a decent experience. only  though because 1) we were never offered all the meats - maybe only 5 or 6 types rather than the 10+ they promise - and we saw all the meats, they just intentionally ignored our table even though we had the green side up and 2) service was so poor and slow. we were never checked on by our waiter, we actually had to get up and search for him to get our bill.

$1 well drinks, half price beer and halp price apps and sanwiches for happy hour, one of the best happy hours i have seen. shannon is a great bartender and i would return to the place just to see her. the only negative was the local regulars who were all cheesy time-share salesmen. they made used car dealers seem classy as they shared their stories of hard selling midwest saps for hours until they gave in. if you are thinking of buying a vegas time-share, stop by this bar first, there is no way you would buy one afterwards.

food is ok, but it is no texas de brazil. the salad bar was the smallest and plainest of any brazillian steakhouse i have been to. nothing spectacular.

the meats were below average and all well past medium rare. the best was the garlic sirloin, the worst was the filet mignon which was way overcooked and almost well done. pork and turkey were ok.

now you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  i've been to other brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  the pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, i got a bloody plate after having two slices. however you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  as for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as two selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common/ordinary to judge.

the sides at the walk up buffet were pretty diverse, everything from capreze salad to falafels. the olives and feta were fantastic! if there was anything missing, it was mashed potatoes.

the meats were equally good. i wasn't a fan of the not-spicy chicken, but the ham served with pineapple was great and the big slices of beef were yummy as well. if you have never been to a brazillian buffet, be warned, their stuff is always extremely salty. i think this is just the style they make it in. it will taste very different from the slab-o-prime-rib at the buffet down the walkway.

6KKWMuqJa1XOz_NpTiNsuQ,2008,"i had high expectations of this place considering my first brazilian bbq experience was with espetus churrascaria in san francisco.  pampas came very close to meeting those expectations.

the food here was really good.  out table, including myself, ordered a combination style dinner that included meat and seafood.  i was under the impression places like this only specialized in meat, so the seafood was a delightful surprise and a nice contrast to red, bloody and savory meat.  my favorite items on the menu: picanha (served nearly rare), louisiana sausage, herb chicken, scallops wrapped in bacon, fried cod, and grilled pineapple.  surprisingly, they didn't have any chicken hearts (a popular item among my friends).  our waiter explained that it was a menu item they used to carry, but scared a lot of people so it was taken off the menu.  the salad bar options were larger than expected, they had a good variety of veggies and pastas to choose from.  i particularly liked the fried mashed potatoes and fried bread.  the sea food plate was awesome. it's delivered to the table as it's cooked, that way you don't get seafood that's been sitting under a hot lamp.

we were seated promptly from our reservation time. the place is setup nicely, with quasi private areas for large parties.  the area we sat in could easily host a party of more than 20 people.  our waiter was very friendly and personable.

once we were seated, a barrage of waiters came out to deliver our food, one just as quick as the other.  as we got halfway through our dinner, things began to slow down, the waiters approached us more infrequently.  but by this time, i was already full out of my mind so i didn't care much.  i think it was apparent my stomach was waving the white flag of defeat.

the only thing i didn't like was the lack of selection when it came to their bbq options.  there was still plenty to choose from, but not as much as i expected having gone to other brazilian bbq's restaurants.  as far as price goes, be sure to have a wallet to match your appetite.  this place is not for penny pincher's.  overall, i really enjoyed this place.  i would definitely revisit pampas the next time i'm in town.",4,1,0.0028651922055130674
4Gm2TQnfxWs-wI8-L9lmKg,2018,"this is going to be a pretty extensive review. but here it goes. 

reservations: reservations were easy, and probably the only good thing about this place. called on saturday, set for monday, checked in a couple minutes late, but was still seated within 5 minutes. 

seating: we were seated right at the entrance of the restaurant. that meant every single guest coming in or out of the restaurant passed by our table. some people were coughing and talking real loud and having conversations in ""our bubble"". disgusting. 

service: my wife and i sat at our table for nearly 10 minutes before our server came around and greeted us. when he finally came around, he sat down menus, walked away, and didn't come back for another 5 minutes for our drink order. we had the groupon that allowed us unlimited drink for an hour. to paint a picture of how many times he came by our table to check on us, i got two drinks. two. drinks. one that i initially ordered, and a second one 40 minutes into our dining. he only stopped over when i had managed to catch eye contact and wave him over. 

he was also too busy tending to a larger group seated right near us. this group was loud and obnoxious. incredibly rude to surrounding guests. and the females walked around barefoot. what happened to sanitation rules in restaurants?

initial impressions: the restaurant itself is very clean. the buffet area, however, looked like a low budget hole in the wall chinese buffet. plates had grease streaks and bits of food on them. i had to shuffle through 3-4 plates before i found one that was clean enough for me. 

food: buffet selection was very lacking. compared to texas de brazil (same price range) was very subpar. warmers were left open. tongs were left inside warmers. food bits were left on the countertops. all not being a problem had the staff that were responsible for that area, were actually doing their job. how do i know they weren't? because they were standing around chit-chatting with each other, a couple of them were even on their phones while they were ""wiping"" stuff down. by that, i mean, moving a towel in circles while texting. unsat. 

the meat gauchos came around once every 10 minutes. there was literally a point in our dining experience that we sat for 15 minutes and had not seen one server. at their competitors restaurants like texas de brazil and fogo de chao, you can't show down the barrage of servers coming at you all at once. 

all of the meats were very dry, chewy, and overly salted. i like salty food, but this was way too much. i also like my beef medium-medium rare. we were served a piece that looked like it could have been picked up at your meat counter at smith's. there's a huge difference between rare and completely raw. 

overall: won't be visiting ever again. sadly places like this in the strip will still be frequented by the unknowing tourist. but for locals like myself, we now know better. my wife and i's favorite hands down is texas de brazil. excellent service. excellent meat. awesome buffet selection. and we had no problem leaving a $40 tip to i am not ashamed to say i didn't leave a tip for our server. i believe in servers earning their tips. regardless of what they earn an hour is of no responsibility to the consumer, and all a grudge that needs to be take up with their employer. if you're relying on tips to makeup for what your employer lacks to provide, you better damn we'll be performing as such. subpar performance begets subpar compensation.

the plate of seafood we tiny cooked and boiled shrimp served like shrimp cocktail, the mussels were overcooked, the squid or octopus was not even chewable! and it looked like the plate had been served before. 

the meats came out either raw or dried and well done. i didn't see any chicken come out and no pork choices either. the waitress was never around either for refills of drinks.

even with a reservation, we had to wait a while (about 30 min), it's a popular spot.

you are seated, a friendly waiter greets you and takes drink orders, then you're sent to the serve yourself hot/cold food bar. this includes sides such as rice, grilled squash, salad, and my ultimate favorite part of the whole night.... (gluten free) brazilian cheese bread aka pao de queijo... oh my goodness is this bread amazing. it may have been the highlight of my entire trip to vegas!

our travelzoo deal included a bottle of house wine, it was a cabernet sauvignon, and it was nothing special- a ca cab that was metallic and pretty cheap tasting. this wasn't even offered by the glass on their wine menu, so i know it was a cheap offering just for the deal we had.

then came the meats...  i believe there were 12 that came around? chicken thighs, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages, lamb, pork, it seemed unending. we had to turn down most of the meat they offered because i was so full from the sides. i had the idea in mind that they would be bringing a huge slab of meat around, and that it wouldn't be fresh. this is not the case, they cook a fresh item then walk around with it once until it is gone, then bring something else fresh a few minutes later. 

there is a sign to put on your table, a wooden sign with a green side (bring more food) and a red side (we're taking a break/done right now), but even when we had it on red they still didn't skip our table just in case we wanted the new meat.

however, putting that aside we were seated shortly after arriving... and waited. our server had a dismissive attitude and was more concerned about a dirty table needing to be cleared in his section than introducing himself and taking our order. then after having to repeat our drink order three times he still managed to bring the wrong drink ...not once but twice. thereafter he was pretty much absent from our table-- --however, very noticeably impatient with another couple as he kept looking at his watch as they tried to decide what they wanted. towards the end of the meal he did inquire if there was any item we'd like more of and i mentioned the tri-tip which never again came our way.

we were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. our server named juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should i say was too busy  favoring the group before us. it made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. but what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which i felt juan didn't deliver well. 

i had brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! bucca di beppo or bravo's, all located in hawaii probably could have done a better version. it's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing i liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! my husband had surf & turf rodizio with ""unlimited"" meat serving and my in-laws had grilled salmon and skirt steak (not part of this review) while my child had loaded cheese fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all ots because we have a picky eater). 

going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. they seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. not a big fan of dead carcass (i'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so i can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but i can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

to end the night, we had some confusion with our server juan. i should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. like who does that? i guess only pampas brazilian grille! or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. plus, the way juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. and call me stingy or whatever, but i didn't like the force tipping impression! that's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. at that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because i had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so i can go on with my dinner. plus it's not even ice cold! they charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. there was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

the restaurant was super duper busy when we went. luckily we had reservations. one thing i noticed off the bat was how close together the tables were set up. for a place that has servers constantly going from table to table with skewers in hand, you would think they would allow more walking space. but nope! thankfully we were on the outside vs in the middle of the dining area. 

now the food, the servers didn't come to the table all too much and when they did, the meats weren't all that great. they were dry and tough. i don't remember there being a lot of selections offered either. there were also a lot of empty pots in the salad bar. they obviously had a hard time keeping up with the crowd that evening.

z4WFdocvaHXh4g24N7QaqA,2017,"so i would probably say this is the absolute worst restaurant in las vegas. the service is horrible. the food is horrible as well. i will start by saying that all of you should spend the extra 10-15 a plate and go to texas de brazil. that place is amazing. 

today we went into pampas simply because we had a 100 dollar voucher towards lunch. we got the voucher at a discount show ticket place on the strip. and now i completely understand why they give vouchers here. because they suck and they can't get business otherwise. 

the meats were cold. and tasted horribly. if you have ever been to a brazilian steakhouse you'll know how they come around to the tables and ask what you want. flip the card green to get more. the gauchos here acted like they were miserable. oh and he asked my boyfriend if he wanted top serloin and literally cut it over me in my face. refused to walk around to his side of the table. and anytime we would say we wanted more he acted like he was appalled.

they didn't serve you the rolls as appetizers. they put them in one of those metal catering heat warmers and had you get them across the restaurant. all of which were rock hard. the only thing good at the salad bar were the mushrooms. 

the meat was so rare it was bleeding or it was super well done. no one ever asked us how we wanted the piece to be cooked (typically one part of what they cut off is less rare and some is more so usually the people who serve ask what you want.  nope. you just got what you got. 

the server was only attentive to our drinks. i had to ask her twice to take out plates as we had no room for anything. and to top it off their systems were down so they couldn't get our check right or run credit cards. took 40 min for them to get it straightened out. and that was after we asked for  the check which we had to sit for 15 min before we got her attention. and then they still tried to charge the card the full amount so luckily we scrambled up enough cash and just left that. not a single offer or apology from management about this. the least they could have done is tried to rectify the situation the best they could. but they didn't.

after waiting half an hour and after seeing many people being seated that arrived after us i got up to see how long it would take. lyzette the liar that probably made up the name said we were next. then she kept calling more people in front of us so my wife confronted her again. she got a little nasty and argumentative  with my wife. we were then called and they tried to punish us by attempting to seat us in the bar which is a mile from the salad bar. we said we were offered a bar seat when we first arrived but wanted to sit in the restaurant.   that is why we waited to begin with. they made us wait another 10 minutes until i asked to see the manager who tried to seat us in the bar again. we walked out.

cheese options on the salad bar were cubes of cheddar or pepper jack. the rest of the salad bar was equally disappointing. 

the feijouda was black beans in extra water. zero seasoning or meat was evident. they also did not have any faroafa to accompany the feijouda.

the caprinias were meh and the meat was surprisingly bad. poor cuts of meat with little care given to their preparation. the selection was also meager as i only saw tri tip, sirloin, lamb and chicken wings. 

service was relatively poor, i was able to run out of meat several times. the frequency or the servers circulating was spotty at best, and they tended to skip tables.

_oI_W6JL5YtcvVArI6fMwQ,2015,"i bought a groupon deal for pampas brazilian grille while in las vegas on vacation with my husband.  the deal was the surf & turf rodizio lunch for two with two specialty cocktails and one desert for $47 (lunch). 

we went shortly after the new year and las vegas was still rather busy with tourists so we didn't expect to be seated right away - however - we only waited 10 to 15 minutes and we were led to our seats by a staff member (we later learned that heather is the manager and she was just lovely to us).  we've been to restaurants similar to pampas churrascaria before, and i really do not know what the negative reviews are all about but our experience was nothing short of brilliant. 

the food was amazing. our groupon included seafood, and everything on our seafood plate was just delicious. my husband is a huge mussels fan and heather even brought out a bowl of just that - mussels heaven! instead of cocktails, we had a beer and a red wine. we're simple like that. the servers kept on coming with the meat, and i think my favorite was the pork while he loved everything beef (other than mussels). our desert was tiramisu and it was just the perfect ending to our awesome lunch. 

heather was very apologetic for making us wait, but honestly, we were so relaxed that we didn't know why she had to apologize.  food? great. service? awesome. customers (us)? happy. 

i understand that customers cannot all be 100% happy but our experience couldn't have gone any better.  maybe we just had a better attitude coming in. we already were having a great day and pampas churrascaria made our day in vegas even better.  some customers just like to complain and i wouldn't let the bad reviews sway you.  i say go and try this place out; try everything (they even have a great salad bar) and come out fully satisfied. also, know that vegas gets busy at certain times of the year and so when it is the busy tourist season there - expect a wait. that's just how it is anywhere that attracts so many people each year. if you don't want to wait, go to a small town and eat. duh.

we were seated at an out of the way table, and i was immediately worried that service would suffer as a result, but we were never left waiting for more meat.

the wine was great, and the owner even came by to chat with us for a little bit and tell us a joke about the little ""yes please""/""no thank you"" button you use to signal whether or not you want more food, after which he gave us $5 off our next bottle of wine.  it's generally a great marketing trick to get you to buy more wine, but we'd already decided to have another bottle anyway, so it just felt like a nice gesture.

the salad bar was a little on the small side, but frankly i didn't care.  that wasn't what i was there for.

more than 15 friends and i all traveled to las vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday on may 24. one of the places the birthday girl was excited to eat at was pampas. she made reservations and everything was set. so we all get there and they kindly accommodate our very large party (20). everything is going well, the food is not too bad, but before the waiter leaves, the birthday girl asks if he could separate our checks. sure, he says. later, she asks him again. same response. we get our check (which totaled more than $1,000), and they tell us they can't separate the check. the birthday girl asks to speak to a manager. when it came time to confront the waiter about the whole separate checks issue, he calmly says ""no, she didn't."" so, when we ask the manager to rectify the matter, she says their policy is to charge 15% extra to do so if there are more than three cards being charged. that's an extra $150 just so they could charge us separately -- after we asked them more than once to separate the check. before this, there was never any mention of any charge. the manager was quite unforgiving and rude. once we decided to simply put the whole amount on another friend's card, she nonchalantly asks, ""would you like dessert?"" it wasn't free, by the way.
i'd just like to say thanks, pampas staff, for ruining what would have been an otherwise pleasurable birthday celebration.

we didn't even receive the red/green stick indicating when we'd like our food. not even 30 seconds passed from the time we sat down with our buffet plates to the time the meat came out. it gave us a feeling of being rushed -- before we were even given the chance to start eating.

as for the food, it was not too shabby. the filet mignon, though, was bland and dry, even though it was quite pink in the middle. which shouts, ""i've been lying around for a while!"" it definitely wasn't terrible, but not worth traveling from four different states and $1,000 just to be treated rudely. i'd suggest any of the other thousands of other places to eat in las vegas that truly understand what customer service is all about. very, very disappointing.

HStf1XxEuEc6mRugFzcCpA,2013,"wow, the food and service at pampas was so bad, i regretted coming here even though i used the groupon ""two for $28"" voucher. if it wasn't for the voucher, i would have screamed bloody murder.

anyway, coming here on weekend during lunch hour, we only saw a few tables occupied which we didn't think it was a good sign. but we went ahead and decided to give it a try before reaching any conclusion. after we were seated, i looked around and noticed nobody was really enjoying their food, and not a smile in sight (including the staff.) 

after we got salad and soup from the salad bar, we must have waited like 10 -15 min before two staff came out with skewers of meat. we were starving but the look of the meat didn't even look that good to us. the meat were cold, under seasoned, and very rare. and that was the way it was throughout the rest of lunch. at texas de brazil or fogo de chaos, they always re-roasted the meat when they brought it back to the kitchen. at pampas, they rarely (no punt intended) do that so all you got cold, under seasoned, under cooked meat. funny thing we noticed that for a meat joint, most of the customers (including myself) kept requesting grilled shrimp because it was the only thing considered good to eat.

now let's talk about service. since this place is like dead, they kinda copied that feeling into their service. even though the place wasn't crowded at all, it took the waitress a freaking long time to refill my soda. everything we asked for something, it took her so long to get it even though she wasn't busy. how do i know she wasn't busy???? well, because she would go back behind the bar counter, right in front my my view, to either count tips, put on make up, check and text somebody from her phone. our waitress didn't come by often either, so you can imagined everything took a long time for them to bring it to us. even though she wasn't rude and got what we asked for (eventually), the lack of care, service, and depressing environment just made everything worse.

for those that visit vegas and think this pampas is good, you gotta spend some taxi money (about $15)  and visit fogo de chaos or texas de brazil. the food quality that you get at either place will make the taxi fare worth it. trust me :-)",1,0,0.9227307501264299

we were from out of town (as i'm sure most customers are) and had a groupon for the surf & turf rodizio buffet. we called on our last day in vegas to make a late night reservation (i think at 10pm), but when we showed up, the host table was closed and we were told that they were no longer seating and would be closing soon. we pointed out that we had called and made a reservation and once the manager showed up, he got us seated. 

even though it was their employees mistake to let us make a reservation that late, we were so impressed with the service and how they made it right. the manager waited on us himself and he kept his entire kitchen staff around to serve us. we felt kind of bad but they were so gracious and never made us feel like we were imposing on them, and truly took ownership of making sure we still had a great experience. i wish i could remember the name of the manager because he was amazing and i want to give him props.

the food was pretty good -- i probably would have given it  but the service bumped it up. the rodizio meant we got to try tons of options, and some of them i really didn't care for (bacon wrapped chicken) but some of it was really delicious. the drinks were also really good and nice and strong!

when we got our main dishes, i thought that my salmon was pretty average. it also came with sides of mashed potato and green beans. with the plate of side dishes that i got earlier, it was plenty of food for me. my husband agreed as well with the food that he got.

service i would give , my girlfriend and i were 10 minutes late due to the marathon street closures and the lady was very accommodating, but just didn't get a very welcoming vibe from her. our waiter was great, very attentive and funny. we asked for a refill on the mimosas, he forgot, but later apologized and fixed his mistake. 

food-wise, eh, it's okay, we arrived around 3:40pm, just before dinner started so we were lucky enough to pay the lunch price but also get the dinner meats. i would say there were about 6 different types of meat that came by, nothing grand, but definitely a jaw workout, it was either dry/tough or bland. you also get a plate of unlimited seafood (salmon, bass, mussels, shrimp), which i thought out of everything was better than the meat itself. 

the dessert at end though, we got tiramisu and it was delicious!! it even looks beautiful, probably the best tasting thing there if i have to be honest hahah

the meat was just ok too.  it tasted good but not as flavorful as other brazilian food i've had at other restaurants.  the staff will come around to your table every few minutes serving you meat such as chicken,  sausages, beef, & lamb.  we also had the brazilian lemonade which was very tasty & frothy.  we had a voucher for 50% off dinner and got a pitcher of sangria.  this was good too but the alcohol content was a little low. i wish it was stronger.  our total cost was under $75 for 2 people.

the environment was beautiful, softly lit, and romantic.  our waiter was good.  however some of the staff bringing out the meat didn't pay attention to our, ""stop serving meat"" card when we wanted to slow down from eating.  that got to be a little annoying since we were trying to have a romantic conversation.

lastly i personally didn't like the photographer taking photos without informing us they were to purchase. when we sat down a lovely woman who works there asked to take our photo.  we said yes not knowing what's ahead.  then she walked away without saying anything.  she came back later with two photos printed out with vegas cardboard frames.  then asked if we wanted to purchase one for $20.  we said no. then she offered another deal and we said no.  finally she offered both photos for $10 without the frames, and we said no.  please be aware of this if you don't plan to purchase.  it felt like a setup and didn't like this inside the restaurant.  it would had been better just letting us know up front.  the photos were beautiful though.

i'd been to the same pampas location about 5 years ago, and that experience was unremarkable, so i thought i'd give it another shot when a groupon popped up.

so, service was excellent. management was atrocious. rodizio food was below average. salad bar was mediocre at best.

it started when we checked in at 6:25pm for a 6:30pm reservation. they overbooked, so we weren't seated until 7:35pm...remind me, what's the point of a reservation?

our waiter, monfre (sp?), was very attentive, as was the girl circulating to make caipirinhas tableside, good at her job. the compliments end there.

between paramedics coming through the restaurant to resolve an undisclosed issue, or security restraining a guy at the door (prob furious at having to wait an hour after his reservation time, too)...at least there was free entertainment.

the food was decent. not the best rodizio, but the ayce basic meat came with 6 different proteins and the salad bar. with fifty different cold and hot items at the bar, you are bound to find something to eat. unlike other places i have tried, the offerings are cheaper in quality and it showed. the fried bananas were just breaded bananas that were fried not the plantains i was hoping for. pastas and bean dishes are offered to fill up diners. 

the six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, bbq chicken, pork, and sirloin. the latter were the best items. the beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. the pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. the pineapple was something my friend and i wished came around more frequently then once. the chicken didn't have much going for them. not spicy or bold, so throwing chimichurri on them was the only way to spruce them up. the meats took a while to first come around, but once it started it was a blitzkrieg.",2,1,0.050475623425137894

pros -
ok price if you get groupon, restaurant.com, or other ""deals""
very clean, great location if you're at planet hollywood
decent food selection

cons - 

worst meat cuts of all brazilian steakhouses i've ever experienced
smaller selection
dismal poor salad bar comparative to regular brazilian buffets
service is ""rare"".  in other steakhouses someone stops by every minute, here you might not have someone stop by for a while, and then you're full and ready to go home - maybe it's their strategy.  
several times when i'd asked for well done i was told ""sorry we don't have it"". like what? sorry you don't have well done meat? 

when they do stop by you might not see the same meat cut ever again and since it's not self serve, you're s-out of luck unless you ask them specifically to bring another serving of something you liked, which may take a while. 

this really isn't as much all you can eat as it is ""all we think you can eat while we have it by your table"". 

but it's not just about quantity, like i said, service, meat cuts, preparation, and quality aren't nearly what you'd expect from places like fogo de chau or texas de brazil.

decor was okay but you are seated really close to other people and there wasn't a lot of room if you are making trips to the salad bar.

we had questions about the menu.  they do a table side sliced meat deal... they call it a ""parade of meats"".  they run between $48.95 to $54.95 including their ""50 item hot and cold salad bar"".  the rest of the menu was priced high too.  

funny thing about the service... when the came to offer my husband his first ""slice of meat""... he didn't even have a plate... when we asked about getting a plate... they told him he had to go get one at the salad bar.  really... you want to charge someone $48.95 for a meal and you have to go get your own plate.  what???  (okay, so we had a $10 off coupon but still... if i am paying $$$$ for a meal.. i want real service)

i had the boulliabase (small over cooked split lobster tails, about 6 shrimp and a lot of mussels over pasta in a broth) which also came with the all you can eat salad bar ($39.95).  over all... was only mediocre and i ddin't even take my unfinished pasta back to our place.

mhusband had the ""meat parade""  which included pork tenderloin, tri tip which he like, filet (parmesean crusted), a dried out chicken thigh, ham, sirloin, and some bacon wrapped turkey i think.  my kids had the sirloin and the tenderloin (around $35 each as well).

sFDRjNiRm10trptDrHurvA,2018,"this was a bad experience. we went there for my wife's birthday and got there around 9. they told us they were still opened. it seemed strange as the place didn't see as busy as you will regularly see on a brazilian churrasqueria restaurant. we didn't see that many waiters with the meats. 

we decided to go in anyways. 

we sat down and our waiter told us we could ask her for any cuts, or we could just ask any of the other waiters carrying the cuts. 

first of all, there are no sides brought to you to the table. all of the sides like mashed potatoes are in the back where the salad bar is. btw, the salda bar doesn't have that many options. and it's way in the back next to the kitchen. and not a really good sight back there as the is a window you can see in to a not that very clean kitchen. 

so we got our sides and salad and came back to the table. our waitress asked us if we wanted any drinks, we said now, and she later came with a bottle of water which we were charged one buck per person which i guess is fine. we also asked her about the meats they had and she told us 2 were already out. so we asked for pichana. 

we waited like 10 mins for the guy to come and get us the first cut. all this time we didn't see anyone else serving meats. we thought that was strange especially because there were other patrons dining. 

we then notice that it seemed that the waiters come out with meats like every 5 minutes or more. they are not constantly coming out with several meats being carried by different waiters. basically one waiter will come with one meat, not coming to all tables that have the green light on at their table and the same guy will go back and come out like 5 to 10 mins later with another meat. in the inter, maybe another waiter may have passed with another one. 

we also got the seafood buffet, and the only thing that was added and brought to the table was a late with like 10 shrimp while 4 other seafood cuts were supposed to be included. 

the flavor of the meats were just ok too. we were there like an hour and we only got pichanna twice, one sausage and one piece of chicken.l as to get each one took forever. 

to sum up, this restaurant is very disappointing. it is not a real brazilian steak house and churrasqueria 

not recommended. for more than 64.00 dlls per person, might as well go to a better place and get a way better dinner experience.",1,0,0.9920042560224628

first of all, our server never asked us at the beginning of the meal if we had coupons/vouchers/etc. but then at the end of the meal when i handed it to him, he responded ""this is why i asked you at the beginning if you had any!!"" i told him he never asked me, and then proceeded to walk away without a word. it's not like i was trying to be sneaky about how i was paying. we just usually hand our meal vouchers at the end of meal when paying. i asked the speak to manager. 15 minutes later a manager walked by the table, not even stopping to introduce himself, and says as he walks by ""we don't usually honor those since you didn't tell the server at the beginning of the meal, but i will this one time"" and continues to walk away. never made eye contact with me or anything, it was so awkward and rude. so the whole paying for the meal situation was just a disaster. 

but also food, such a disappointment!! for how much money your spending, at least the food should taste good! it doesn't. the buffet is very unimpressive. and the servers bringing the meat were few and far between. we weren't even there at a busy time but we were there almost 2 hours due to how slow the service was. at least the people sitting next to us were nice and they made up for lack of customer service. they were laughing and joking about their awful experience too! 

and honestly our server was a nice guy, just not great at his job since he was new. it was the manager who handled the whole situation who i was most disappointed with. if your manager, act like it. i hope management reads this review to improve the restaurant. with all the dining experiences in las vegas, this place needs to step it up if they want to compete.",1,0,0.9999340133671069
VoSkCXXkXMVHHCX9XN9QoA,2012,"had a quite yummy lunch here - thanks to a groupon. $28 for surf n' turf lunch for 2 - 1/2 of the normal price. i don't eat seafood, so there was a bit of a waste there. i have only been to one rodizio style restaurant before so i was expecting the seafood to come around just as the meat does (and be able to turn it down). it actually comes out separately on a plate (with 4 types of seafood) and they won't take it back or let you take it home...but that's really besides the point. the salad bar was very good in my opinion - cold salads, hot pasta and rice, soups, cheese biscuits, and more. i thought all of the meat was delicious as well, especially the bacon wrapped turkey. they also offer lunch for $20 without the seafood, which i would gladly go back and pay full price for. i think the prices might go up at dinner time, but i can't really imagine what more they can offer, so i would say stick with lunch.",3,1,0.303000006348512

so, to bottle up my thoughts. only go if you get a dining card that discounts the dinner greatly.  if not don't even consider going here :) oh, and give the hostess with the short hair a big raise!!!",3,0,0.9064401686262803

the service was meh.  i had to ask 3 times for a ginger ale and also, they sometimes skip our table with the food.  =/

my gf asked for a arnold palmer, but the waitress refused because they make their lemonade fresh squeezed.  so she was afraid the consistency would be off.   but i have to admit, the lemonade was pretty tasty.

the pineapple was amazing.  its like a burst of tropical refreshment to your mouth after mounds of meat.  

i also liked the salad bar.  the chese bread was simple, but delicious.  the antipasta was good, and the artichoke salad was fresh and juicy.

because of my encounter with bob, who asked that we revisit the restaurant before we departed vegas, we did. and i assure you it was a much different experience. both visits, the food was good, but i am a stickler for customer service. not only did bob rectify my issues on my first visit, it was obvious that he addressed my concerned prior to visiting again. it was also surprising to see that he was at work again, so obviously he takes a hands-on approach to management and has great work ethic.  the side items were different on each visit, and we even tried some of the other menu items.

i would suggest that you do not go if you are in a rush or if you're starving, the relaxed atmosphere is designed to take your time eating so that you can savor the items as they travel through the dining area. i would recommend the brazilian bouillabaisse. it was full of flavor and had a wonderful spice. i would go again when i travel back.",3,1,0.06848130507997507

let me just say, my husband and i are churrascaria fanatics. we love us some brazilian steakhouses...so when we were offered a free meal (and show) for sitting through a dumb time share presentation in vegas, we took it! we can save money and eat in one of our favorite types of restaurants, so why not?! 

now i know why it was free. the salad bar is left to the imagination, with very little on it. they had cubed cheese. cubed!! what are we? four year olds? the hot food wasn't any better. it looked like it had been sitting there with no one to stir it or check on it. 

now let's get to the main part. what should have been the main event...the meat! wish i could tell you how it was...there was at least 10-15 minutes between each gaucho...our server (the bartender) never asked us how we liked our meat (which is always asked at any brazilian churrascaria restaurant)...so we would ask our gauchos for medium rare. not once did we get medium rare. not once. it was medium to medium well, and even well at one time. the selection of meat is as follows: ham, ham, ham, sirloin, ham, ham, sausage (burnt), ham. what the heck! where is the beef?! they only had sirloin. nothing else. and it was mediocre at best. service sucked-we have never had our drinks empty at any other places, but we had to flag down our server (the bartender) 3xs to get him to refill our drink. when we complained that we never saw the beef, he came (20 minutes later) with a plate of burnt sausage, two chicken legs, and ham on a plate. what the heck?! 

oh-but my favorite part...we had asked for clean plates, so our server (bartender) took our plates and said he would be right back with clean ones...of course this would happen to be the time that a gaucho stopped by with meat...he asked if we wanted some and my husband pointed out that we didn't have plates...the gaucho then proceeded to say, ""i can put it on the mini plate (the plate that holds our tongs) until you get your plate..."" um, no?! ugh. i hate incompetence. 

they charge $2 for ""bottled"" water when you ask for water-they place the bottle on the table and then conveniently forget to tell you it's a charge...

mcmPhdenzoEvCfs_MreHyQ,2013,"amazing service, amazing food, and amazing experience.

this was my first trip to vegas and found a groupon to pampas for a really great price .my boyfriend' and i decided to get it.

flash forward to today 7/30/13: everything at pampas was great. we really recommend this restaurant. the food was very good, except the reason for 4/ instead of 5/5 was that some of the items were a bit to salty in my opinion. but still good! 

what really blew me away was their customer service, our waitress was awesome(i think her name is kelly, long haired brunette)  and the guys serving the meats were super friendly. even with an unexpected incident during our lunch that pampas could not prevent they very kindly offered us another lunch for the next day on the house!! that truly says a lot to me about the manager and their staff. 

now on 7/31/13 , we had a different server i think her name was miranda or something like that. idk if she was new but she never checked up on us or anything it was always a different girl getting us new plates and drinks. so that felt a little weird but again we had a great experience here and definitely recommend it!! 

thank you pampas! definitely a to go spot for us on our next vegas trip

_JOKg8J3HmTVHzpOtyE-7g,2007,"i think i enjoyed the whole experience of a brazilian grill more than the actual food itself.  doesn't make sense, i know...but i liked that the servers brought out huge cuts of meat on these giant spears and sliced it right at your table, and there wasn't too much time inbetween meats.  there was also a big selection of hot side dishes and cold salads to choose from at the salad bar buffet.  the downside  was that the hot sides weren't so hot and the cold salads were about the same temp.  i liked the beans, rice, and the yummy parmesan-crusted moist and flakey rolls (which managed to stay warm).  those were the only memorable sides.  the memorable meats were the pork loin, moist and well-seasoned, although a bit too salty, the turkey sausage, thick and juicy, the spicy chicken, crisp on the outside, moist inside, the roast beef (deliciously tender) , and the lamb, though not that tender had great flavor.  and the grilled pineapple was the bomb.  that night we had efficient and friendly service.  

of all the choices you have in vegas, this is a pretty decent one if you get the discount price from the ""1/2 price ticket booth"".  it's a great deal...you pay the ticket booth a $3pp fee, they make the reservations for you (definitely recommended) and give you a voucher for $19.99pp.  the all-u-can-eat meats and salad bar is regularly $36.99pp.  my total bill, including a glass of wine, tax & tip, was $35.  not bad for a nice restaurant on the strip.",3,1,0.0004925032623255277

i had no idea what a brazilian steakhouse was or what it was about until my girlfriend through her rehearsal luncheon here a few years ago. we got seated right away in a private room and then went out to the main floor to grab some salads, greens and other appetizers. they had a pretty big selection so i assumed that was it. 

boyy, was i wrong. a couple of waiters came in the room with these huge skewers of meat. i thought it was the coolest thing...they serve and cut the meat right in front of you. then other waiters kept coming in with other different meats and fruit and then the first waiters came in again but with different items. i was such in awe. all i remember was that everything was sooo good and whoever had the bacon wrapped chicken i told him to keep it coming (lol).",4,1,0.03370268366520712
XJVBRa-IrhXAorOlKxzF2w,2014,"ok
first off, we only go there for lunch, before 4pm. so i can't tell you  what the place is like for dinner. but i have been there for lunch going into dinner and the only difference we noticed was a couple of extra meats we didn't care for. 
anyway. even if we had to pay the full price of $20 for lunch (meat only) we would still go very week like we do. however we bought a dozen $25 off $37.50 or more coupons with our air miles from restaurant.com. this makes our bill $16.22 w/ tax for the both of us. with a $6 tip it's $22 for an excellent all you can eat brazilian lunch. you can't get a buffet on the strip for this amount, nor most fast food joints in the mall. 
amazon locals is an excellent site you ought to get emails from. they often have coupons for sale for this place. they often cost $4 for the $25 coupon. which still would make your bill only $20.22 for two of you.

i believe the restaurant is in a crap location, this is why it has to do so many promotions in many areas. it's in the mile of shops at planet hollywood, kind of at the back of a row of restaurants on the north side of the mall  by the rainstorm mess of a show.

now to the food.
salad bar is at the back of the restaurant and kinda tight, but the food is awesome. my boyfriend loved the marinated carrots. i love the large meatball sized mozzerella balls and salads.
the meats come out on skewers from the staff who are often and many. i would say there are seven or eight different things on a regular rotation; pineapple, bacon wrapped chicken & sausage, flank steak, bbq pork, sirloin steak (my favorite) chicken legs (pretty large too) and i think there's something else that i can't remember. any way, we have never been disappointed with the food. if the meat comes out too raw, just ask your server to get it cooked more. i hate it when i read on here that the food came out to rare. i like it that way, but my boyfriend doesn't, so we always ask for a better cooked piece of the steak and they come right back with it. just ask people, don't wine if you can't be bothered to open your mouth and ask.

i think this place goes through a tonn of staff as we have been 10 weeks in a row and never had the same wait person twice. however, they are all good and attentive. never had a problem with the food or the staff. will continue to frequent this place every week until we get bored with it....which will be never.",5,1,0.04395352746710268

i had the meat roditizo, unlimited access to the side bar (not salad bar) which was fresh and delicious, the cheese bread is my favorite. if you are looking for salad bar they have a few premixed salads (thus the disappointment of a few reviewers), on the side bar, but its mostly side salads, potatoes, soup, fruit etc...
one out of the eight meats i tried was dry and two of eight i got a 'bad cut' (fat and grizzle). i enjoyed all, however with the sausage being my favorite overall. 
sangria from the bar was delicious, although not very potent (if you are looking for such things).
service was attentive, although the hostess was not very friendly and i noticed other diners having issues with certain servers. once the meats started coming, they continued at a good pace, with a emphasis on the chicken (often times paired with other meats such as bacon or sausage).

over all i was dining with a restaurant.com discount, and i was pleased.

after the tour, we were nothing but convinced! all you can eat meat and seafood. the salad bar was fresh and food was excellent! we went during lunch, so it wasn't to busy. our waiter was very friendly and helpful. he made sure our drinks were re-filled and plenty of food stayed on our table.

sv8dGSmrCPHRruJyxwFIcA,2012,"service = 
food = 3 solid stars
value = 

i ate here for lunch twice and breakfast once when staying in vegas across the street.  i was with wife and kids and wanted quality food, nice setting, a bit away from casino smoke.

it's a very nice setting.  upscale interior, solid furniture, nice waiting area.  service was uniformly good if not great throughout stay.  it's a nice upscale all, right on the strip, and most importantly, it was very reasonably priced compared to other vegas strip eating options.

if this was in henderson, i might give it 1/ off as value would fall.

they have an excellent $6 steak and eggs breakfast.  steak is top sirloin, served to your desired temperature (like mine medium).  eggs were standard scrambled the way i ordered.  potatoes were fried ""home fries"".

for steak and eggs of this quality, would have paid twice this and been happy.

now on to lunch.  i had the meat ""buffet"" option both other times.  now, most importantly you have to understand this:

* quality of meet for $20 buffet lunch is not going to be what you would get for a $40-50 dinner buffet at other brazillian restaurants.

it's just not going to happen.  instead, you get very tasty sausage, rotisserie mini chicken pieces, bacon wrapped turkey chunks, and some slice top sirloin.  

no premium meats.

but the meats they give you are tasty and filling.  plus, you get an excellent ""salad bar"" buffet.  i'm not a huge buffet person, but it's a nice one.

cheeses, olives, salads, soups, breads, etc.  i thought the calamari salad was pretty decent, and loved the fresh mozzarella, olives, artichokes, heart of palm salad, and a few other dishes.

so say what you will about this restaurant, but i think it's a decent to very good value.  i think the setting is very nice.  the service is good.  and the food is tasty and filling and not overly expensive.  

i do think you could get very expensive for dinner or if you run up certain menu choices, but that's your choice, isn't it?

just don't think you are going to be in a nice setting, right on the strip, and get the same meal you could get at a fuego de chao.",3,1,0.07563349816392118

uHFKsmZRUgaQsEd8OyKaFw,2010,"we came here for my 30th birthday celebration last month. since we knew this is a meat buffet kind of thing, we came very hungry. we arrived and got seated fast. 2 servers came for drinks or whatnot before our real server even got there. we already had our salad/appetizers in place when the real server came and took our orders: 2 seafood for the girls and 2 meat for the boys. simple, right? let's see...

one meat came after another serving the boys. looks good, smells good, tastes good...the boys had it good for about one hour while the girls sat down nibbling on some salad...waiting for some seafood. we were waiting for half an hour when we asked one of the girls who brought us meat if we can have some -- she said, ""you ordered seafood, you can't have meat."" okay then...

we waited another half an hour for our seafood to arrive (mind you: our real server didn't bother coming during our total 1-hour waiting) to no avail. thank goodness for the salad bar and conversations that kept us sane. 

finally, the real server came and we asked how long it usually takes to prepare the seafood. she scrambled her notepad and from her verbal responses and facial reactions, it seemed to have forgotten that the girls ordered seafood. but she tried to cover it up by saying: ""let me check the kitchen."" so she left. shortly, she came back and said, ""oh i'm sorry, they threw away the paper that i gave them. they're cooking it now. do you still want it?"" we said yes, and she gave us meat plates (to indicate to the others that we are now ok to receive meat). then our server said: ""i will tell my manager to remove the seafood off your tab."" we said thank you. 

4 types of meat came but we were already full from the salad. by the time the seafood came, not only we were stuffed but they were fishy and oily. so we stopped eating after one bite. 

then we recieved our tab. all regular prices. i was confused. our server said that she will remove the seafood off our tab. what she ended up doing is 'replace' seafood with 'meat' instead. replace? that's not the word i remember her say.

i confronted (calmly) our server and told her how i understood her when she said ""remove the seafood"" from our tab and when she gave us meat plates. i said: ""i thought that was your gesture of saying sorry for letting us wait an hour and 10 minutes for our right food to arrive."" then i added, ""i didn't ask for meat plates -- you put it on our tables so that was to imply you're giving it to us so we'll have something to eat while waiting."" and when the server answered me: ""oh, you mean give you $40 worth of free food? no, we don't do that."" at this point, i was irritated. 

so bottom line, we were ripped off. we paid full meat price when we only had time for 4 rounds and a bite of their fishy seafood items. this doesn't even include when the boys had to ask the servers to bring them the rest of the meat mentioned on the menu to make sure they get what they were promised, plus we had to ask for drink refills, and we had to ask for soup bowls in the bar. 

if there was a negative star on this rating, i would give it. only two of the meat that we ate were better than what we make at home -- the rest, mediocre -- not worth for the money.

we used a groupon, so i guess i can't complain too much that my sister and i got our dinners for only $65.  however, the regular prices are ridiculous.  what we had would have cost over $150 without a groupon. 

also, be careful: if you ask for water, some waiters will automatically bring you bottled spring water and then make you pay for it.  if you want free water, make sure you specify.

UXiwPnHsdHPY4J2b0sj-mw,2013,"my husband and i discovered pampas through groupon as we enjoy brazilian bbq.  what we discovered is one of our new favorite restaurants that we recommend often.  we also go every chance we get. 

the restaurant itself is comfortable but still retains the atmosphere of a better restaurant.  the service has always been above par, the staff goes above and beyond to ensure their guests (not customers) have everything they could possibly need.  their salad bar is fresh and has a great selection.  actually, i could eat my entire meal from there but their meats are so good i have to remind myself save room for the main course.although i have been to other brazilian places that have a wider selection of meats that come to your table, their selection is still vast enough that you don't feel deprived.  if you leave this restaurant hungry, there is something wrong with you because the choices cater to all eaters.

now it may be on the pricier side, i don't mind paying for quality and service and that is exactly what you get there.  also, if you have groupon or living social, they have deals that really make this place a steal.  we have been back several times and never once have we been disappointed.  i think my hubby would go every week if we could.

TOAf94onOVXg-74lmxQ4hw,2017,"i wanted to really like this place, i like brazian stake houses and the format is fun. but they disappointed in several areas.

typically, this is not an inexpensive meal your paying for the variety of meats and the presentation. there are always add-ons to up charge and increase your bill. expect to pay $50 per person not including drinks. at this price point my expectations are higher than fast food so i hold them to a higher, refined standard to earn more stars, sadly they did not live up to the price.

i came in a lone without a reservation but was quickly seated, that was great since the dinning room was nearly full. i read the menu, people watched, started pyscho-analizing the sales technic of the wine lady, the photo girl and the way staff as they try to get people to take on the up-charge items. why am i pointing this out because after all that i start fidgeting and realize i'd been sitting there 18 minutes without anyone approaching my table, now water or drink order, not wait staff visit, nothing. i had to wave down a waitress to get started, strike one.

the waitress makes not apologies and asked i fi know what i want surprised because as i mentioned the format is to offer you a bunch of other add ons and up-charging or upgrading your order. most of the waiters i observed were working the crowd and doing just that, not mine, just what did i want. i placed my order.

if you have not been to one of these you choose which meat program you want and if you want seafood and other upgrades then head off to a mini buffet for your vegetables salad and other starters to fill you up before the more expensive meats start coming out.

now here they really shine! everything was great, interesting tasty salads, marinated vegetables, several soup choices that all smelled great, cheeses and some better quality deli and more. they want you to fill up on this so you don't eat as much of the higher cost meats to come.

the format in this places is to have a token on the table, often red on one side green on the other to let the roving staff with the giant skewers of meat when you want them to approach or let you rest. there are about a dozen meat choices that are supposed to be part of your meal. here comes strike two.

of the dozen meats i was only ever offered four. this was a failure of the management team, it was clear the staff had not pattern to follow or choreographed direction. they sort of wandered aimlessly offering meat to some people then disappearing to the back leaving many guests looking around in wonder. there seemed to be no reason or purpose, this is easily fixed and sloppy management of the dining room staff. this truly disappointed the most, meat is why you come to a brazilian stake house, the format is variety of small portions that keep coming until you ask them to stop. they failed to execute the basic format correctly. i did receive tri-tip twice, garlic steak twice and both times they pushed more than a normal amount, bacon wrapped tenderloin, and roasted pork. i only got the pork because i finally asked for it and though i also asked for the lamb it never came to my table along with the rest of the selections.

now for a few minor things which added to the overall negative experience. the tile floors were thick with grease and slippery, i saw and older fellow slip and fall near the rest rooms and i almost fell twice myself, this is unelectable in a higher priced establishment. next the up charging water ($1) which was not a lot but thy try and say its a required surcharge from the city (its not). there were a number of other missed items not worth listing that all fall back to a poorly executed management team, poor coaching and poor monitoring to the dining room. 

food was good, what i was able to sample but at $50 a plate and up i expect better service and professionalism. i cannot recommend this location as it's surrounded by better restaurants just feet away. this location is located in the miracle mile near a number of other mid-grade and better restaurants.",3,0,0.9602131052060395

nD9jNWT6yXdwpPAI6Zlrog,2009,"probably the worst brazilian bbq experience i have had. we got a discounted rate through tix4tonight for $20 per person so it was reasonably priced but we got what we paid for in this case. i would be mad if i paid full price. 

at pampas, the service was indifferent. we had water refilled once during a 90-minute meal. the reason it was so long was the meat came out so slowly. all of the meat was overcooked. i think i saw one piece of beef that had any pink to it. all the rest of the beef was grey and chewy. the pork was fatty (which i usually appreciate) but in this case even the lumps of fat was not enough to offset the scaly texture of the over cooked pork loin. the only good meat was the bacon wrapped turkey. if all of the meat was as well prepared as the turkey this would have been a much different experience despite the service. the only other skewered item i would recommend is the grilled pineapple. the salad bar was not big nor was the food there mediocre. finding it was not terribly easy either and certainly not worth the effort. 

if you are in vegas and in the mood for brazilian bbq i would recommend texas de brazil or sambas if you want the convenience of a location in a casino.",2,0,0.9819610685733838
Rl5bn7BPaUZRN6RxYPspIA,2014,"i've eaten at a few of the brazilian steakhouses in town so when i saw the groupon for this place i thought we should give it a try. often when we can't figure out where to eat and we've exhausted our yelp lists, we go to groupon for suggestions. unfortunately, i was less than impressed with our experience. the hostess was fine as she sat us at our table. when our server greeted us he was very nice. we informed him of our groupon and ordered our drinks. the drink cart girl was very nice but a little over the top. we started with the salad bar and there are a lot of good options. when we got back to our table, we noticed that some people had markers to let the meat servers know to come to their table but we didn't. that was a little confusing at first, but then a meat server did finally come to our table. the first few times the meat selection was either bacon wrapped or well done. i informed a few of the servers that i could not eat pork and preferred medium rare. i'm not exactly sure why a high end steak place is serving well done steak as the main cook temp. some pink or red on some of the steaks would have been nice. we did get the surf and turf, but were disappointed that it didn't come with the lobster. i was also kinda grossed out by the shrimp. the coloring was off and it looked very limp/weak. no thanks. however the other surf options were better, the salmon was good and the white fish was very flavorful. 

anyway, after a few rounds of well done meat, we did get one medium sirloin and it was really good. although i was mostly full at this point. i'm not saying the meat tasted bad, because it didn't. it was on the whole quite flavorful, but there should be a varied options for cook temps. medium rare people don't like well done people don't like medium rare. offer both. it makes no sense to only have well done. the service was pretty good, although the table next to us had a lot of issues. she was also irritated that all the meat was well done or pork. we came to a steakhouse because we wanted steak. so sadly this is my least favorite of the brazilian steakhouses in town. step up your game, pampas, the competition is stiff.",3,0,0.9593884154493362

at any rate, we got up to do the salad bar thing and i wasn't disappointed with that part at all. pretty good options and everything looked fresh. great olives.

meats started coming around and a lot of the cuts looked super fatty. skipped those and went for the top sirloin and chicken wings. both very good.

since the ""birthday dessert"" was a must, per our server, i got a tiramisu. pretty good, but i'm a tiramisu snob, so don't mind me.

october 2017 review 
we had no service what so ever. the food was subpar and lacking flavor. 

we were there for a birthday and they sat us in a private room which you think would have been amazing. in reality, we were forgotten about in that room and didn't get the whole service that we were supposed to poor poor service from everyone in the restaurant.

june 2018
we decided to give it another try. we showed up at our reserved time and were seated right away. the place was busy, i was excited.

as soon as our server took our drink order the food started flowing. we were served every single meat in the first five minutes which was just fine for us. 

the flavors were ahhhhhmazing! the steak had those crispy bits from the cooking on it and i couldn't get enough of that red meat!! 

the fish plate has been changed and i liked the change, all except for the fried fish pieces, those weren't so great. 

the salad bar was kind of meh. i've seen them do better with that but i do love their cheese bread. one of my favs. 

the drinks were great, i started with the specialty and ended with white sangria. the white sangria was my favorite. 

once we were served in the beginning, the guys serving the meat started to thin out.

our server then was no where to be found. it took almost a half hour to get our check. 

i wanted to give this a better review as the food and some parts of this place has gotten exceptionally better. seeing as how my first review would have been , i bumped it up to .

they had 1 pork selection.

no chicken hearts (my fav at brazilian bbq joints)

their dessert menu contained creme brulee, tiramisu, and cheesecake.  because those were all invented in brazil.

at least they carried brazilian liquors and made brazilian cocktails.  the bartender was pretty helpful and seemed like a nice guy.

the service was terrible, with the picanha coming around only once.  we specifically had to ask another waiter to have the other waiter come over.  frustrated, we called over the manager.  she was attentive but after airing our grievances (poor service, wtf menu items, and overcooked meats) she primly said, ""sir, we cater to mainstream tastes.""

TwrHyx_BMq3g_ahSYRDOVA,2018,"we were here for a free dinner offered as an incentive for attending a timeshare presentation, and i give it  based on that it was free (although, it really wasn't free).  the star rating might actually have been only two stars based on the overcrowding at the restaurant (saturday night) and the little tricks they play to up the price beyond free.

i think we would have been incensed if we had had to pay the high menu prices for what we got, and the rating would have been two stars based on a poor value for the money, if we had been regular paying customers.

first - the good - the salad bar, with the soups, pastas and other foods, is actually among the better you will find at an ayce brazilian steakhouse.  the greens were mostly crisp and fresh, and the various dishes tasty and good.

our server joseph - was very good.  i felt that he was just a cog in the wheel of this restaurant, and had to play the part of its spokesman, so i didn't blame him for their little ""charge you for extras"" tricks.

although our meal was supposed to be free, apparently the free tickets got us only the salad bar and chicken (wasn't clear to me if it was ayce chicken, or just a plate of chicken).  our server told us that for ten dollars each we could upgrade to the ayce menu, which he kept pitching, but i just cut him short and told him, ""yes, you can have the ten dollars.""

however, as it turned out, even with the upgrade, we didn't get any seafood with that ayce (although the dinner menu online includes both meats and seafood (shrimp and fish), still for whatever reason our ayce experience did not include any seafood - we would have had to pay $18.95 for a side plate of shrimp, is what we found out later).  we also got a can of guarana soda which definitely packs a punch, free for our yelp check in.

over all, the meats are average quality.  probably the picanha nobre (brazilian top sirloin with sea salt & olive oil) and maminha de alcatra (tender tri tip roast seasoned with sea salt), were best, although really it depended on the cut being presented and how long it had been cooked.  the filet mignon with cheese on it, was dried out and not that great.  the lamb too, was a little dry, but i have to admit that good lamb at restaurants in the u.s. is very hard to find.

also, we never saw the file de costela (tender rib-eye roast seasoned with sea salt).

the chicken legs and pineapple were fine.

without the free tickets, the ayce would have been $64.95 each.  the quality of meat and the overcrowding at both the too-close-to-each-other dining tables, and the too busy salad bar (was hard to get at the food at times due to the crowds), detracted from the experience.  

also, the way the dinner was promoted as free, but ended up being something you had to pay extra for, and the way seafood was on the menu in the ayce but ended up being extra, was representative of the over all desperation i felt this restaurant is experiencing.  desperation, in my book, is a precursor to quality's going way down, and eventual restaurant closure.

i mean, we had a massive seafood sampler and caesar salad with superb service, privacy and quiet elegance, at aquaknox at the venetian, two nights prior for just over $100., or could have paid even more for - granted more food - but a sort of cattle car experience - at this restaurant.  you decide which way you wish to go.",3,0,0.8258993669472642

three assistant waiters brought us a bottle of water within 5 minutes, a server attempted to serve us someone's shrimp that we did not order, they served our appetizer and dinner at the same time. the filets and potatoes were good except the green beans were way overdone! my friend did not get her lobster tail with her dinner, we were told they gave it to someone else.

to top it off, we were seated in the outside area, near the front door. we witnessed the waiters with the meats on the sticks walking through the palms out front to get to the other side with the meat touching the palm leaves.  it was very busy with a long line so the waiters were walking outside between the customers in line and one touched a customers hair.

NyqDflPIG9AjsBzfbqx3lg,2012,"i'm a bit spoiled here, i must admit, because i have been to several top notch rodizios (fogo de chao, texas de brazil, boi na braza and nelore) - and pampas really doesn't match up to those in food quality or variety of offerings.  i think if i had never been to a rodizio before i'd have been somewhat impressed, as the picanha was pretty decent and the seafood that came with the surf & turf was surprisingly decent.  but, most of the meat was a bit dry, except the picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken.  the ham was very salty.  the sausage was actually fairly overwhelming by itself, but probably would have been fine as small slices in an italian dish.

the salad bar had a decent amount of coated salad type dishes and standards but nothing i had was really exciting.  they serve the ubiquitous rodizio cheese bread as part of the salad bar instead of fresh at your table, and fried bananas instead of cinnamon plantains are on the bar as well.  

one thing i will give them top marks for is the service - our waiter was super nice and attentive, in fact there was a slight mixup (not their fault) that they handled very graciously.  i had booked my reservation for 11 but didn't realize the rodizio didn't start until 11:30.  we ordered a couple cokes and were going to wait, but my honey wanted to just leave and come back.  so when i offered to pay for the cokes and explained we'd come back later, our waiter said not to worry about it, but just come back and see him later.  so i tipped him pretty big for the cokes and then again when we came back on the full meal.

i am giving them a 3 overall, though honestly anyone who has been to fogo or tdb is likely to grade them far more harshly in comparison.  if you get a discount to come here via tix4tonight or groupon it becomes a much better value for your money, but it's still not really the best example of rodizio by a long shot.",3,0,0.7518323553955079

UMPJsTSQSqLk6YoenIA0PQ,2013,"i've been to many brazilian steak houses with rodizio style service and was expecting to have a great experience (since this is vegas of course). this was not the case. this was the first time i went to a brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.

the meat: the main reason why we went here was to get our meat fix on! it was bad...i mean bad. the quality of the meat was equivalent of the ""t.g.i. fridays of brazilian steakhouses"". the meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done,  everything else was over cooked.  the seasoning on the meat was almost non existent. we were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat, but it wasn't there at all. just overcooked meat with no seasoning. to be honest, the meat even tasted old i kid you not. the brazilian sausage is something i really looked forward to (at other brazilian restaurants as well) and my fiancee and i looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage. they say it was made in house on the menu, but seriously, they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items. 

the salad bar: i kid you not when i say this, but i felt like i walked into a grocery store salad bar. the fried bananas shouldn't really be deep fried with breading on it, its supposed to be in a pan with i assume butter and sugar. the bananas were breaded, but not only that, they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a long time.  the cheese bread are also one of the big reasons why we go there! they were stale and dried out (also have been sitting there) you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.  the soups were a disgrace as well. chicken noodle soup and lentil soup? really? i don't really know about the lentil soup, but chicken noodle doesn't scream brazilian to me. even their competitors texas de brazil have lobster bisque!  they even had eggrolls at the salad bar! wtf?! if i wanted egg rolls i wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.  this was unacceptable.

the service: we waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated, so it wasn't bad. when we did get a table (there were many other tables open) we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutes. we were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us! the manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over, pushing the desserts and wine when we haven't even been given any other food or water for that matter. 10 more minutes pass (now 25 minutes after being seated) and our server comes up to us and literally says ""hi my name is david, i will be your server. please let me know if you need anything and go ahead to the salad bar"" and then quickly walked away to tend to another table. 
i suppose i could add this to service, but there was a lady with a ""drink cart"" that was really pressuring us to get the caipirinha, the brazilian cocktail. when we said we had them before, she asked oh, you didn't like it? why not? i don't know lady! leave us alone! they really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us, i suppose it is their job, but damn it made things awkward. the whole drink cart idea was tacky. 

the only ""pro"" i can honestly add to this was the $10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant, but even with a combined $20 dollars off  for my fiancee and i, it still wasn't worth it at all.  i would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to texas de brazil or fogo de chao because even though they are a ""chain"" they know what they are doing service wise, and especially the food (meat!).  

i usually write about places that i love, but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting. i've been to many brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.

my first experience here was dreadful and i evaluated it as such but management immediately reached out. they apologized and invited me back for second try -- complimentary of course. it took me about six months to get back to vegas and simultaneously have enough free time to come into pampas. 

they did a really great job this time! i want to note that i did not feel as though all attention was on me but rather the normal level of service was offered. the meats were very good though not nearly as wide a selection of them as in many other churrascarias i've been to. the buffet was adequate, not stellar. but then i never understood folks who went to town on buffet selections when they've dropped the bulk of their money on the giant skewers of meaty goodness.

the gauchos were professional, polite and they knew about the protein they were weilding. drinks were solid. servers and hostesses very nice. it was a good experience all around. 

i also appreciated that toward the end of meal the manager on duty came by to see how things had gone and to hear in more detail what had gone wrong the first around. we had a good productive chat without getting anyone in trouble. i've said this before, sometimes recovering from a challenging circumstance is more telling of the substance of a team than seeing that team cruise through an all-systems-are-check kind of day.

in that case, get the party rollin!  it was my birthday so we easily polished off two pitchers of sangria during our meal.  the bill came and it was over $200 for two people! wth? after our meal at about 11:30pm, we spent over an hour with the manager who refused to refund us for the ""$9 sangria"".  the waitress even admitted her fault to the manager, but ol' cheap ass wouldn't budge.  talk about a buzz kill! 

the next morning i had to call down there again and harass the guy to give us our well deserved credit.  he offered to ""split"" the bill with me.  hell no! it was their fault for misrepresenting the price, i was not about to split it. especially on my birthday!  you cheap bastard.

horrible service, unwilling to cater to their customers - we asked for the store manager, and a chef who claimed to be the manager came out and explained to our party that pampas churrascaria does not care for their customers and their loyalty. also, they don't really welcome groupon users, especially the ones, he stated, that come weekly apparently. the restaurant was nearly empty at the time we went since it was a weekday, yet we were rudely dismissed by one of the passing servers after being seated. thankfully, our designated server was welcoming and attentive... or maybe it seemed so compared to all the other employees we came across before finally being seated.

food
lunch meat choices are limited to dry chicken, dry&tough picanha, other dry beef choices, sausages & pork (the last two of which i did not try).
seafood was okay. seafood unlike the meats is ordered through the server, and surprisingly we did not have any problem at all. it included salmon, shark, scallops, and shrimp.
salad bar had a small, but good variety of salads, pasta salads, soups, bread, etc. the pastas were dried up and looked like they had been sitting there for a good amount of time.

ambiance
when i first stepped into the restaurant, i had a good feeling about the place. it is next to the todai in the miracle mile shops, good location, and decorated well as all or most restaurants on the strip are. the workers looked professional at first glance, and it looked like a nice dining place. my friend and i actually purchased another groupon to come again while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. mistake! i asked groupon for a refund right after we left!

at such a reasonable price, we wanted to give the place a try, but what a disappointment. i would've given the place a second chance despite its horrible service; however, the food is just not worth it. you get what you paid for, maybe less with this place. fogo de chao all the way!",1,0,0.9494308273712811

aogW864cbrv7zPQ6air0Bg,2016,"if i could give this place a zero, then i would. this was the most horrible dining experience that i've ever had. it is no surprise that they continue to move their business page! 
our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. earlier that day, i passed by pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. it was a buy one get one free offer. i inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. she told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner.
we were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. it was a sunday night, and we were sat right away. this was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. our server, karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. the caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. we later found out that they charged us for water! we did not request water to begin with. she should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was not sparkling at all. i asked karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said ""nevada has the worst tap water in all of united states, and i would never drink it."" obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. btw, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle. 
karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. i asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was ""well this is vegas!"" wth!!! this girl was so irritating. i informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. what she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills).
time to eat! the salad bar was horrible. it looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. totally looked unsanitary. karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement. 
the meat options were horrible!!! i was already irritated by karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! at the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. we asked karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. it never came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. more lies and decit. they were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. they could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.

this is a set up. in theory, it sounds amazing! buffet with 12 different grilled meats carved at your table for a relaxed and filling eating experience. throughout the entire strip promoters are passing out buy one get one coupons which sweetens the experience even more. the problem is, it's a tiny buffet with limited sides, i only saw 5 or 6 meats (no where close to 12), and it was a constant fight to get the few meat selections to your table which caused frustration...not relaxation. additionally, the bogo coupon was bogus! we did get it half off but you couldn't buy the basic buffet, you had to upgrade to add the grilled shrimp and a beverage which makes your total $4.50 cheaper than the price of the regular buffet. doesn't sound like payless bogo sale to me. other than the gimmicks, the few grilled meats we had were actually tastey. the ham and steak were really good! if you did not prefer rare meat, you had to request it separately which caused more waiting and frustration. there wasn't a single side that i had that was amazing. just different cold salads. i think the buffet deserves to be $25 and needs some additional sides.

there are essentially 3 options on the menu: meat, seafood, and both. i believe the meat was 43, the seafood 48, and the combo 54. i got the seafood and my girl got the meat. yes it's ok that sentence was funny. 

i am a brazilian steakhouse neophyte, so i was a little surprised that the first thing we do after ordering was go to a salad bar. this was disgusting. wilted salad, stale bread, and a stab at asian cuisine that makes pf chiang's look like nobu. i grabbed a little caesar salad and cafeteria pasta salad and braced for the worst.

and worse it got. first of all, as soon as we sat down from the salad bar they immediately started piling my girlfriend's plate with food, but my seafood took 25 minutes, so that was slightly awkward. however, it did give me a chance to sample the meat. 

the meat sucked. we had pork tenderloin first, which was woefully overcooked. this was followed by beef that had some kind of cheese crust that was disgusting. the procession that followed was all mediocre at best, and it was all overcooked! we went in late, like 930, so maybe that was why everything was dry and well done. but for the price i don't think it's too much to
ask for properly cooked meat. the lone exception was the lamb, which was delicious.

eventually my seafood came. it came with baked salmon, cod, shrimp, and mussels. the menu claimed bacon-wrapped scallops were included as well, but we didn't receive those until we requested them. it was essentially buffet quality seafood. the mussels were cold. only half the shrimp were actually peeled. the fried cod was hard and hot on the outside and cold on the inside. when the scallops finally showed up, they were also cold.

we skipped dessert. the whole experience was dismal, and the modicum of savings we got from restaurant.com didn't really make up for the waste of 2 hours. planet hollywood is simply a black
hole for food, i would avoid the whole hotel.",1,0,0.9998758442872916

the food itself was fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  the chicken and sausage were my favorite meats, and thankfully the chicken was moist and not dried out like it can get sometimes.  the beef dishes were ok, but i found the meat to sometimes be tough or chewy, which is surprising considering how it's cooked.  overall, a perfectly pleasant meal, and thank you to pampas for hosting the party.",3,1,0.46215060360880234

jKRRK35aj30OyQjzHbq36A,2017,"we came here in jan 2017 for an early lunch because we had an entertainment coupon (bogo) and with a party of two, the price is reasonable.  however, the experience was still less than stellar and of 3 brazillian steakhouses we have been to, this is definitely in the bottom third. 

first, they don't bother to tell you they charge for water - they just put it on your bill. we ordered drinks and they still brought water, then they surreptitiously added it to the bill with no notice or explantion!  this would be consumer fraud in california, but in nevada, where their clientele are mainly tourists, i guess they can get away with it. 

the buffet was barely warm, this just after opening and the bread old (maybe yesterday's leftovers?).  meat service was very lacking, and they seated us at the wrong end of the restaurant (near the bar).  meat selection was minimal with an almost complete lack of variety, and we were at the end of the carving route, so by the time the meat got to us, we only got the inside cuts near the skewers with no crust.  the meat was cold, tough, had no seasoning, and requests were ignored.  when a sausage skewer came out, i asked for 3 pieces, but was ignored - only got 2. meat service was slow, coming by only every 10-15 minutes.

they still come by with a hard sell to take and sell a photo or two - pretty  irritating.

in short, if you live in the bay area, don't bother.  there is no need to go to las vegas to eat brazillian barbeque.  fogo in the bay area is a much better value with better food, even if twice the cost.  miracle mile has several restaurants, and next time, we will go elsewhere.",1,0,0.9997764789089815

42mxScAns-cOoenwot3Zcg,2017,"my boyfriend and i came to vegas to celebrate our two-year anniversary and we are so glad we came to pampas because they certainly helped make it a memorable one!

we purchased the groupon dinner deal for $82 that included the surf and turf meal, one dessert, and one hour of unlimited beers, wines, sangrias, and caipirinhas. if it's still available, i highly recommend purchasing the deal!

location
pampas is a restaurant off the beaten path. and what i mean by off the beaten path is that it's located in planet hollywood's miracle mile but you'd have to actively search for it because you won't actually stumble upon it. it's actually hidden behind two table service restaurants whose names i can't remember, but if you know where the panda express is then you're near it!

reservations / seating
you can easily make a reservation via phone or by open table and i'll always recommend open table because it's just another way to rack up rewards points for eating at great restaurants. we made reservations at the last minute (like made a reservation for 2 at 9:30 an hour before the time we requested) and despite us being late we were still accommodated. granted, it wasn't a very busy night, but i always appreciate when a restaurant can accommodate for us. 

we wanted a more secluded dining area so instead of sitting indoors in the main room or bar area we were seated outside in the corner two top. 

dining experience
absolutely phenomenal. our server hallie was truly on top of her game and had continuously sent us refills on our alcoholic beverages every time she noticed they were running low/empty. 

the meal itself was great. the surf and turf meal includes the churrascaria experience where the runners walk to your tables and offer you different cuts of meat but also includes a family style platter of seafood, which includes mussels, orange glazed tilapia, shrimp, and salmon. if you're on a budget, i'd say skip the surf and turf, but since i bought the groupon deal it was just a wonderful perk of our meal. 

the meats are cooked to medium rare so if you have a sensitive stomach like i do, you can always ask to have the meat cooked medium well or well done and they'll cut a slice for you and cook it inside their kitchen. keep in mind that it won't come out immediately!

one thing i also liked is that if you have a particular type of meat you're looking for, like top sirloin or filet mignon wrapped bacon, you can always ask your server and he/she can order it for you! unlike many churrascarias, this was definitely a great option and i like that they use ipads to place your orders. 

drinks
first, water is not free! i honestly did not appreciate having to pay $2 for a bottle of water and my server didn't actually tell us that because we assumed it was already included in the meal. anyways, just a heads up. 

caipirinhas: they have so many different flavors!! the sweetest is the strawberry and of course the best you'll get is lime. these are very strong in alcohol content and after the third drink, i could definitely feel it... so plan ahead and take a cab or uber here!

sangrias: white sangria all the way. i honestly could not even taste the wine in this at all. it just tasted like fruit juice, which to me is always the mark of a truly great sangria. 

dessert
you get to choose between four different types: chocolate mousse, tiramisu cake, flan, and one other dessert i honestly can't remember. 
we chose the tiramisu and it was a perfect finish to a very filling dinner! the cake was light, airy, and had the perfect hint of coffee. 

--
overall, i would love to return to pampas based on the wonderful experience my boyfriend and i had. my only gripe is that their meat is very dry and they don't exactly have sauces for them either. for a churrascaria, i find this a bit problematic as meats as your specialty and they are not cooked to well done either. so i hope in the future they can find a way to make their meats juicier so that when i do return i can confidently give them the  rating they deserve.

best discount lunch option on the strip: (must have a valid yellow tix 4 tonight dining discount card for this offer)
- $10 ayce salad bar only (reg $14)
- $14.95 ayce meat rodizio (reg $22.00) 
lunch: 11:30am to 3:30pm 

my family and i came for their lunch two days in a row! thank goodness for the tix 4 tonight dining discount card, we wouldn't have found this restaurant and deal. 

the first day a couple of us opted for the ayce meat w/ salad bar option ($14) and the second day we all opted for the salad bar option only ($10). i didn't order the meat option but from what i can observe, there were about 5 varieties of meat on skewers that came to our table. 

if you prefer vegetables over meat, i highly recommend the salad bar only option (what i ordered). there's a vast selection of cold salads (garbanzo bean salad, tomato mozzarella basil salad, couscous salad, pasta salad, green bean salad), mixed greens, the usual accoutrements (olives, carrots, tomatoes, heart of palm, roasted red peppers, cucumbers), assorted roasted vegetables, soups, brazilian bread (yummmmmy crack bread, couldn't get enough), assorted fruits, plantains(!!!), and so much more. (see photos) 

pampas brazilian grille is a unique concept in las vegas dining. an all you can eat brazilian steakhouse, also known as a churrascaria, it's a great place for meat lovers (and vegetarians who can dive right into the salad bar with such a great selection of vegetables and other stuff).

we were quickly seated by the hostess and began exploring the menu.  our server came over - his name was juan and he was awesome :-d we ordered 2 margaritas, and then he told us of a special that he could offer us that would include all the meats as well as unlimited shrimp + the salad bar because we ordered drinks...for less than just the price of unlimited meat on its own! (can't remember the exact amount, but i believe that it was either $33 or $36 - either way, a great deal!).  obviously we took it.

my strawberry margarita was ok - it was a little sweet for my taste, but i downed it nonetheless.

off to the salad bar we went! they had a really great assortment that i thoroughly enjoyed - hearts of palm, tomatoes, various pasta salads, different types of fried peppers, cheeses, salami, mozzarella, orzo, green beans, and our favorite - some kind of fried bananas! honestly, the salad bar was excellent!
we returned to our table with our fully loaded plates.  a plate of shrimp was brought out to us with some kind of light teriyaki-like sauce - it was very good!

then came the meats...i'm a big meat eater.  we were given chicken leg, chicken wrapped bacon, pork, ham, flank steak, lamb, and 2 other types of steak meat (can't remember what they were specifically).  overall, the meat was good, but it wasn't the best i've ever had at this type of brazilian type of restaurant.  my favorite meat was actually the chicken leg - now that was delicious!

still, we stuffed ourselves silly! overall, it was a good dinner and i would definitely return because of the fantastic value for your money, but it's not the most refined or flavorful meat on the planet.  i want to give another shoutout to our waiter juan for his excellent service!",3,1,0.00025993864733064864

mindy was our server & she was friendly & attentive to whatever we needed.  a weird thing she explained was that they charged a dollar per person for water but was up front with it because she didn't want us to be surprised.  

we saw a few reviews saying that the food was so-so & servers weren't that friendly but everyone there was pretty much the opposite & went out of their way to get whatever we needed.  the meats were excellent and came out fast & furious and we were stuffed when we were done.  the salad bar was fresh & tasty & well stocked.  i'd give them a solid ; the only thing i found a little annoying was the noise level; i think if they added some sound absorbing fabric on the walls & ceilings it would enhance the overall dining experience.",5,1,0.0639960102045467

salad bar had a great selection without being overbearing.  and the choices were delicious.

as far as the food on the swords, i wasn't impressed.  compared to other brazilian spots i've been too, there just wasn't a great variety of selection.  the tri-tip was the best one.  the filet mignon was dry and the parmesan crust was awful.  filet should melt in your mouth.  i knawed until my jaw hurt, and that was only after i spent several minutes cutting through it.

all of the poultry was salty.  the turkey wrapped bacon did nothing for the taste of the meat but make it too salty.  

the seafood was decent, but i've definitely had better.
my favorite thing was the ham and pineapple, but only because the pineapple was so good.

it definitely wasn't worth the money we spent.  my one major gripe was the time between the meat presentations.  i felt like we were kept waiting so that our appetites would catch up to our digestion.  i guess that's one way to keep up profits.",3,0,0.7794764996421827

93XRkRbaF_77xQTPvEw_Xw,2013,"so, a little background. we purchased a voucher on travelzoo that was a 2 for 1 deal.  an $86 meal became $43.  after reading some of the reviews on yelp, i was not looking forward to this dinner.  prior to purchasing the voucher, i had read some pretty favorable reviews. that was 2 months ago.  i checked yelp this afternoon before we went to dinner, and i found some reviews that trashed the place. 

even though i am giving this place ,  i started out wanting to give .  the food, in a word, was spectacular.  i don't know what restaurant some of these people were eating at, but both my wife and i found this place great. the salad bar was fantastic.  lots of vegetables such as chinese broccoli and pickled veggies.   caesar salad was surprisingly good.  

if you are a meat eater, you can eat yourself silly.  i especially liked the spicy chicken and a top sirloin that was a special of the night.  

before i get to my downgrades, some advice.   don't bother purchasing a 2 for 1 voucher ahead of time from travelzoo or any other site. we could not walk more than 50 yards without someone offering a 2 for 1 coupon on the strip.  heck, there was some dude wearing some brazilian bird outfit not more  than 50 yards from the restaurant inside the miracle mile mall adjacent to the planet hollywood hotel that was offering a 2 for 1 discount coupon.  

again, this would have been a  review if not for a couple of things that our waiter did that were, let's say, disappointing.  when we sat down, he asked us if we wanted any drinks.  we said ""no;"" however, we wanted water.  he asked if we wanted flat or sparkling and we said flat.  not too long after came a couple of bottles of pelligrino.  about a half hour into the meal, my wife asked me "" are we being charged for this water?""   i brought the waiter over and i asked him this question, and he said ""yes.""  i said ""not a chance.""  he got defensive and i said that nothing was mentioned about charging for the water, and our waiter, to his credit, told us that he would take the water off the bill. by the way, the cost of these two large bottles of pelligrino was $30.  one could conclude that this is how this place makes its money. 

the second thing that the waiter did was bring our final bill and it totaled almost $20.  mind you, we had not purchased any extra sides and no drinks.  our expectation was that we would receive a bill for the sales tax which should have been between $6.80 and $8.60.  i explained this to the waiter. he left to take care of it, and came back w/o any changes.  instead, a 5 min explanation as to why the bill was correct. i was very calm and explained that he was incorrect and why.  he then realized that he got our voucher mixed up with another promotion involving the purchase of show tix.  he brought the check back  and everything was corrected. 

one more thing. another reviewer trashed the place because he was part of a large party and was annoyed that the restaurant added a tip for everyone based upon the full cost of the meal before the groupon discount.  he felt that the tip should be based upon the discounted groupon price. this is incorrect as the waiter is being penalized.   always tip based upon the full value of the meal before discounts.",3,0,0.9592289254544722

zXaeP6DtPH45v6i8HEZ9yA,2011,"what are some of the biggest tourist attractions in the country? times square, hollywood blvd, and the las vegas strip. what do they all have in common? crap food served at chain restaurants. i don't understand why people travel thousands of miles and end up eating at a restaurant that has a location around the corner from their home. while checking out some show tickets we asked one of the employees about some good lunch places that are different than any chain restaurants. it was lunch so we were looking for something cheap, but tasty. the guy told us about a brazilian restaurant called pampas that's inside planet hollywood.

it's no secret, the hotels on the strip are massive and act like a maze in order to force you to walk past as many slots, tables, souvenir stands, and other money wasters as possible. it just so happened that pampas is at the very end of planet hollywood. nice.

we were given coupons for $5 off which includes their salad lunch buffet and the meat rodizio. normally this is $20 which is pretty cheap, but the coupon makes it even better. our server gave us a green and red card thing and we were told to flip it to the green side when we get back from the buffet and the meat carvers will start making their rounds to our table.

the ""salad"" buffet was amazing but it didn't have too much salad which is fine with me. there was a few different pastas, vegetables, cheeses, and a couple types of salad. i'm not going to lie though, my favorite thing at the buffet were the squares of feta cheese. i downed at least fifteen of those awesome squares of happiness. also, they had slices of salami which were fantastic.

i'm not much of a carnivore, but every time one of the meat carvers came over i got extremely happy. the choices included smoked ham, bar-b-q chicken, spicy chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, bar-b-q pork, and sirloin. the best ones in my opinion were the sirloin and sausage. i couldn't try the bacon wrapped turkey though because of my stupid allergies. dumb. one other option they had was grilled pineapple which was just as delicious.

this is definitely a restaurant that makes sure your tummy leaves happy. the ""all you can eat"" style usually fails miserably in regards to taste. however, pampas seemed to excel higher than any other restaurant i've been to of its nature. we were so full when we finished that we all had to sit back and relax for a while before we started walking down the strip again. i ate so much that i think i heard the chair crack a little before i stood up. whoops!",3,1,0.03558356001830432

""two"". she poured my glass of water and the one across me, saw my vegas4locals voucher unfolded, stopped pouring, let out a little growl, shook her hair directly over the water of my guest, and walked swiftly away. maybe a bug flew in her ear. maybe she had forgot something that she just remembered. maybe she didn't like my voucher which was not free! i bid many times on 7 other auctions before i won(?). after the ladies arrived, she came back and asked what we wanted. i introduced the ladies as current a-list banquet food servers and me as a former one. a normal reaction is to celebrate, because it is virtually impossible to screw up a great tip. after ordering, she explained that we needed two plates; one for the salad, and the other for meat. she circled behind me, and then walked across in front several feet away. i confess that my next question was a rudeness test. ""that was two plates, right?"" she answered, ""toooo plates"" as she looked down at her pad while shaking her head no, and moving two fingers back and forth while twisting her wrist both ways. try doing all of that yourself. that two stupid word reply ""toooo plates"" has kept me awake more than once, because nobody could be that rude in this business!! my watery drink took an hour. i heard, ""are you finished with this?"" on my right; i looked to my right, then to the left. she had taken my salad plate, and within earshot i said' ""nooo"" to no avail. finally, the check comes; i know that's what it was because she showed it to me from 4 feet away for a full second before closing in on the ladies. wait one f#&%ing second. i understand that i'm not much to look at, and i carry a shillelagh, but if a server wants to talk about the check, they better make sure that they are indeed talking to the host. besides, goddammit, ""i'm a man, not much of one, but a man.""~~daniel tosh. while i waved for the check to come my way, she turned left and got it closer to tomie, one of my former shop stewards, so i leaned in to see. this little pos was telling tomie that any gratuity should be based on this number and not this one. i leaned as far as possible, and she moved the check about 1/8 of an inch, so that i still couldn't see anything. i got her attention loudly! ""why won't you look at me?"" ""i thought that i was looking at all of you."" ""well you weren't!!! at this point, i can't remember very much while being this upset, but i think that i demanded she leave. she was taking the initiative of discussing the tip!!!! almost nothing gets you fired more quickly in the service industry--it is the golden rule. maybe that's why i leaned so far, because her voice got soft so nobody but tomie and sabe would hear her. i threw two one hundred dollar bills for the $189 bill into the wallet which she picked up, began to walk away, turned around, and said kindly, ""do you want your(?)...""  not again!!!!!! she was begging a tip for a second time!!!! i exploded!!! ""don't you...... (as i shook and pointed a finger at her)"". i calmed a little and said, ""bring me my change!"" that last one was an attempt to get 11 stupid dollars. i have never even seen or heard any server being rude or blatantly initializing discussion of the gratuity. reviews that i read mentioned the servers were rude. i said it was bs. it took me 2+ weeks to start this review. i was so mad that i wouldn't tip; another first. my guests tipped $35. the manager smiled like she had a mask on as she listened, that's it. i held my glass as i left so that sorry excuse of a waitress would have to stop me for a final stare down alone. i didn't go for the food; i went for the service. a hot dog would have filled my tummy. read  brazilian reviews for food authenticity. owners: your restaurant is in the toilet.  is anyone still hungry??????????",1,0,0.9984819142686394

the customer service? it was terrible. we saw our waitress 3 times in an hour and half, waited for water and drinks with empty glasses on multiple occasions, and we're treated with disrespect when asking for the kind of service one would expect when paying  $50+ for a meal. 

as for the food, by far worse than anything i would have ever expected. every single meat was tough and overcooked. even the meats that appeared to be cooked medium rare to medium were as tough as leather. the ""steamed"" shrimp were ice cold, and the oysters were undercooked, salmon was okay, and the spicy sausage was really the only thing i can recommend. cheesecake was pretty good as well. 

we also found a massive black hair (see picture) on one of our plates that did not belong to any of our party members. we then asked 3 different servers to see a manager, and 15 minutes later, the manager said ""oh, sorry"" and walked away and was never to be seen again.

EzYPEsbUChsAz5TYKruO5w,2016,"only visit this location if you're not paying. nearly every step of the visit was off, starting with our seating. we had 4 pm reservations, as much to enjoy the food and its unique presentation as to be able to beat any friday night crowd. when we approached the exterior host/hostess stand, we found no one there, which was fine as there wasn't a line, only us. we walked into the interior host/hostess stand and waited for someone. again, no staff member. when we were ""greeted,"" the staffer acted annoyed, as if we'd disturbed her by making reservations and arriving for them. despite absolutely no one else waiting to be seated and literally tens of open tables, we were told to wait. we waited for 15 minutes for no apparent reason and the person who seated us was only slightly more friendly than the first staff member. 

our waiter was nice, which was a pleasant change, but other than bringing our drinks and clearing plates (not particularly efficiently, by the way), he really did nothing more. in the area in which i live, the two brazilian steakhouses offer much more engaged wait staff. this is important because pampas literally prints what you should tip on the bill. not the usual 15%, 20%, 25% amounts, but a literal ""you're bill is x. the tip is x."" as someone who wait tables to pay off her grad school debt, i'm a damn good tipper - when i get service. our waiter, who treated us no differently than the other tables in our section, took a drink order, refilled our water (also, don't drink water at this place - there's a ""water conservation fee"" that isn't revealed until you get your bill. while i agree that the southwest is close to water crisis mode, pulling this without informing customers is just shady) and only sometimes cleared plates from a crowded two top. when we wanted to leave, we waited 35 minutes for the bill. for this ""service,"" we had to give the guy $33. 

we had a groupon that, according to both groupon and pampas websites, was the equivalent of $142 in food and beverage. the ""surf and turf"" option was to include eight meat selections, four seafood options and ""more than 50 hot and cold side and salad choices, "" according to the groupon description. um, no. as to the salad and sides, the only way anyone is getting to fifty is by making roughly 30 odd salads with various toppings or considering plain mashed potatoes one option and mashed potatoes with butter or gravy another. while i did not count every hot or cold station on the buffet/bar, my guess is that there are less than 20 stands, but that these contain selections with multiple items, like an antipasti station with a variety of meats, cheeses and vegetables. that does not ""50+"" options make.

on to what these folks believe is worthy of paying close to $60 a head to eat: the meat (and in this case, the seafood). have you ever been to very run-of-the-mill asian buffet? if the answer is yes, you've had the equivalent of the salmon, tilapia and mussels served by pampas. every piece tasted over-sauced and looked, tasted and smelled like it was cooked before well we arrived - exactly like a strip mall buffet. those buffets, however, don't start at $38 per person and tend to be much more satisfying.

the meats, you ask? only slightly better than the seafood, with the exception of the top sirloin, which was wonderfully flavored and extremely tender for that type of cut. the chicken drumstick i got was so overcooked, the leg bone actually shattered (and scattered, much to my chagrin) when i cut into it. the meat looked desiccated, which was a bad start for the meat course. in the two plus hours we were in the restaurant, only five of the selections (one of which was grilled pineapple) came to the table. again, this wasn't any different for anyone else in our section, given the immense amount of time we had to observe other tables while we waited for the bill. 

the offer included dessert - frozen cheesecake, purchased in bulk - and two cocktails. i opted for a caipirinha, the national cocktail of brazil, an excellent aperitif. while well-made, it was far more boozy than i had hoped, especially since i would be driving. my companion, who had been drinking the night, opted to have a soda. while i get that the deal included two cocktails, we thought it was silly that our waiter didn't switch out the cheaper soft drink for the never ordered second cocktail.

on top of all slowness, weird charges and marginal food, an attractive woman with an accent as beautiful as the rest of her, rolls a heavily stocked bar cart throug the restaurant, slinging drinks (possibly at an upcharge from the bar) tableside. while i enjoy a hustle, especially one with style, was odd at 4:45 pm, in a sparsely seated room. additionally, while the woman - again, she was lovely and the only staffer with a personality - didn't reek of desperation, the ploy did. once the bill arrived, we felt like it was a slow, bad tasting, scam.

the waitress was slow and not overly friendly.  the atmosphere was cheap and almost reminded me of a mexican chain.

31AQgwGXiBqKDmfaTe9Drg,2010,"pampas is a brazilian steak house located on the south side of planet hollywood.  in short, it's a decent alternative for hungry carnivores who are tired of buffets.

if you haven't been to a churrascaria, it's an all you can eat affair where there's a nice salad bar and a few side dishes - but instead of a buffet, the staff bring large skewers of meat around to your table.  most places have a signal (like a coaster) that says ""more please"" or ""i'm still chewing"".

i guess i'm spoiled by fogo de chao.  i have visited the dc location several times and it has become a favorite stop for me and many of my traveling buddies.  pampas is the same concept, except executed with value in mind.  said differently, target and shopko are both variety stores, but i'm pretty sure most people would much rather go to target if given a choice.  pampas is the shopko here - a little less quality, a little cheaper, and a lower atmosphere factor.

the meat is ok - certainly comparable to the stuff served at outback or any other chain restaurant and is a little over seasoned.  the preparation is good, but not great.  the salad bar was pretty fresh and had a reasonable variety.

we were seated quickly and reasonably well attended to by the friendly staff.  we had to wait a bit on some of the meats, but not enough to complain about it.  the convenient location is nice, as are the short waits.

i'm on the fence with the stars here.  certainly, i could go 3 in terms of overall quality and experience, but it's the value quotient here that leaves me cold.  if you can score this for $25 - it's an easy 3-star experience.  if you get suckered in for $40, then it's a bust down to .",2,1,0.381069253302748

i wasn't happy with their service though. they were really slow in coming by with each meat. the servers seemed too lazy to walk around our table to serve, instead, they had us clumsily pass each other each slices, which was annoying. it doesn't take that much effort to take a few extra steps to serve us. they were really slow in filling our drinks, left all of our glasses empty most of the time. and even more slow in bringing our check.",3,0,0.9935347964239556

although this is not agora, it was pretty good all you can eat churrascaria!  their sides were a bit disappointing, as i was hoping for more.  we got the surf and turf buffet - the grilled shrimp was just okay.  knowing what i know now, i would probably just order the meats without paying the extra for the shrimps because it wasn't worth it.  their meats were nicely favored, but it wasn't amazing.  i have to admit that i really did enjoy their roasted pineapple - it was a nice in between meats!  service was excellent - our server was a super nice older gentlemen!

HBk8-J9EfSHs3IEA-AylPg,2019,"we had a $99 groupon dinner for two.  for the amount of food/drinks you get, i think it's a good deal.  we made a reservation and were seated about 5 min after we checked in with the hostess.  she wasn't very welcoming but they were extremely busy that night so maybe she was overwhelmed.  we went on a saturday night and the place was packed.  i'm talking every seat had someone in it, including those outside of the restaurant.  there is not much privacy or space between you and those seated around you.  i could hear the convo at the table next to me clear enough to join theirs and my sister and i had to talk pretty loudly to each other throughout the meal.

it was a little confusing who our waiter was since two kept coming by to check on us.  i appreciate the extra effort, but it seems like they are a little disorganized.  there were plenty of gauchos and the meat just kept on coming, so zero complaints there.  we also had no issues ordering alcoholic drinks (yes, the groupon includes those!)

the salad bar and side bar were well stocked the entire time we were there.  they were on it!  those items were fresh and tasted decently.  most things, like the mashed potatoes and gravy, needed salt/pepper.  my favourite meat out of them all was the pork.  i don't eat pork often but it was flavorful and very juicy.  the steak/filet mignon that they had was most of the time cooked rare, and if you wanted it cooked longer you had to ask.  the surf n turf plate was very minimal, and unfortunately it was room temp, but that's ok with me b/c i don't eat a lot of seafood anyways.

the groupon also came with a dessert.  we chose tres leches dessert and split it.  it was enough for her and me, especially after all the meat we consumed.  it was an average experience so i'm relieved i didn't pay full price.  rodizio is a better option at this price point.",3,0,0.6499089731554983
z0nD4mkU8iXfPNJW__fr6A,2016,"terribly overpriced and poor service. do not come here unless you want to kill time and have $$ to throw away. i regret not checking the yelp.com reviews before coming here. we came for lunch on 2/13/16 because of a discount voucher we bought from tix4tonight (half-price booth similar to those in nyc). two of us both ordered the all you can eat meat ($21) lunch option.

my history: been to fogo de chao in nyc, baltimore, and san francisco multiple times, once at texas de brazil in chicago.  very familiar and love the brazilian steakhouses in general. 

1. service: arrived at 1pm on saturday 2/13, seated at 1:10pm, but waitress ashley did not show up until 1:20pm. drinks (2 glasses of water) arrived at 1:30pm. the restaurant was less than half full at this time, so i don't understand why it took this long. 
2. meat carving service: the meat carvers (only 3 guys for 20-30 tables) are bringing out meats every 7-10 minutes, compared to every 1-2 minute at other brazilian steakhouses. we spent 80% of the 1.5 hours meal time waiting for meats to come by. i finally spoke up and alerted the manager, who said she will send meats our way. the carvers did show up within the next 10 minutes, but with an attitude.  
3. meat quality: the meat carvers are not educated about how to slice the steak (especially picante, the top sirloin), and cut out 1/2"" slices that are very chewy. out of the 8 steak slices, 2 are blood-dripping raw (i asked for medium rare), 2 have chewy tendons (taste cheap), 2 are fibrous tri-tips (i spit them out after chewing for a while) and only 2 are edible. when i asked the carver to return with medium rare steak, he complained why i am not eating the raw piece, which has a pool of blood sitting on top of it. please see attached photo. 
4. meat selection: we were promised 7 meat options according to the menu, here is what we actually saw during 1.5 hours of waiting:
-chicken wrapped with bacon is overcooked and dry. bacon is crispy though.
-pork sausage is good but on the salty side, so i couldn't eat more than 2 bites without drinking water.
-picante, the signature brazilian steak top-sirloin, only came to our table 2 times, after the manager got involved. one piece was amazingly tender and the other piece is surprisingly bloody raw (see my photo). quality control is poor. 
-pork loin is the best and most edible part of our meal. juicy and tender. only came to our table two times though. 
-tri-tip steak is fibrous and chewy, so i finally spit it out after chewing on it for 2 minutes. 
-grilled pineapple is not ripe and sour.

in summary, even with the discount we had, this is not worth the money. i hope you read the reviews here and decide to go elsewhere. it is definitely not worth $21+tip+tax per person for lunch. frustrating experience and will not return even if it is a free meal.",1,0,0.9995267820226839

this was the worst experience from the word go!
we went here on time share coupons and and our waiter was completely inattentive and just didn't care to deal with us. his push was for a ""double"" on my cocktail out the door, which came immediately, and it took a good 10-15 minutes for the rest of our party to get their drinks.. that was how it started from there on timing was horrible... meat started coming before we were ready and signaled as such. 
the shrimp was not deveined ( major
poop vein) and the mussels were very overcooked and rubbery so they were essentially inedible. 
and then there was dessert, we ordered coffee and espresso first then the tiramisu. the tiramisu was soggy and lackluster at best. the worst part is that we completely finished out tiramisu before the coffee ever arrived. 
when we received the bill we had some questions and our waiter was bit snotty about having to answer them. 
then came the final straw, card was used to pay bill( tip was in cash) when we received the charge slip back for signature a  "" mandatory gratuity"" had been added to the charge slip and he had kept the cash. 
we took this to the manger who looked bewildered and lost as we explained the situation.

unfortunately, the service was slow and, for a while, there was only one man going around serving.  the ""seafood"" option was simply a plate of fried seafood (that came out cold), it wasn't exactly what was advertised, as we were under the impression it would be served out similarly to the meat.  and, though the meat was above mediocre, the lack of servers definitely put a damper on the meal.  sadly enough, i was most pleased with the salad bar.

to top it all off, our waitress was fairly rude and made comments under her breath about how our order came out wrong (as if it was our fault).  i'd suggest going elsewhere -- with the amount of money you would spend there, you could go to a lunch buffet at bellagio!

my parents bought my girlfriend and i, whom are both vegas industry workers, the groupon for pampas for her birthday; we have never been so let down.

we both had surf and turf, which was fantastic, when we didn't get a charred end piece of meat. they are authentic and cut the meat off skewers, which leads to various inconsistencies. example, the tri-tip just came out, i got a burnt piece with almost no meat at all, while the next piece was perfect. our meat server seemed to have noticed but as with every table, just wanted to get his round done with. 

besides jonathan, this is the worst staff in vegas. they seem as if you are a burden, unwilling to be friendly or helpful about any inquiries towards their cuisine. it's in the way they won't look at you in the eye, return any manner pleasantries or even smile.

i have never been so unimpressed with a restaurant in vegas and when $147 gets two surf and turf dinners, two drinks and dessert.. you could dine at a plethora of better eateries.

Jxs_Xd8yTiJ8wOlzVY3a7w,2016,"this is a letter i wrote to management regarding our experience this past weekend on fathers day. this review has nothing to do with the food. we ended up cancelling our order and leaving this place because of the poor offensive service. 

dear management,



i took my family of 9 this past sunday to your restaurant for the first time. none of us have ever been to pampas and none of us have ever gone to a brazilian steak house. we heard about brazilian steak houses and how they work but for our first experience at pampas it made us never want to try pamas or any other brazilian restaurant.  we did not get to eat the food mainly because of the service. 



we waited 25 minutes to be seated and that's expected but then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for anyone to even come to take out drink orders. we were served water a few minutes after being sat and that was fine but when my sister in law asked for straws, the woman that served the water answered impolitely and then brought back a handful of bar straws (after i had just watched her handling a tab) those straws had no paper or covering on them aside from us being uneasy and most of us not wanting to even drink from those straws because someone else has already touched them, the table was dirty with dried crusted food and one of the tables was loose from the top of the table where the food is placed. usually a table gets lose from the legs. 



after this, someone finally came to take our orders. she explained the 2 big options and them proceeded to ask if we wanted the option with sea food or the option with only meat. we were all confused because we were given menus with several other options but she was only giving us 2 options. after disputing this with her and expressing our confusion she told us the reason why she 'suggested"" only those 2 options was because if we try to share we would get charged. this is understandable but she then proceeded to tell us that we were being watched by cameras and  that whom ever was watching us will have her charge for an additional meal if we are ""caught"" sharing. mind you, one person on the table was deathly allergic to sea food and is also a vegetarian so this person was going to order from the buffet. we had 3 children on the table, one whom does not eat sea and none of these 3 kids would have to even order a 30 dollar all you can eat meal because....they are kids and kids don't eat that much and finally another person on the table does not eat red meat. 



this waitress pushed a 2 options that only 3 people on this table would have/wanted to order and then offended the entire table by telling us we were being watched so ""no sharing"" as if we were a class of 10 year olds. after she took our orders she let us know that there was going to be a one dollar charge for the waters we received. we did not ask for water. it was served to us without her asking. 



after she left, we all looked at each other and decided to leave. i canceled the order with the waitress. she insisted she had already put in our drink orders but by this time we were all offended. i did not tell her the reason because it was just to much. we just wanted to get out of there. this was our fathers day for our dad. he always wanted to try eating at a churrascaria but now he feels he will never go to one because of this experience. 



most of us know how buffets and brunches work. you pay per person. we went in knowing that this place would work the same way (from what we heard how a brazilian steak house works). we had no intentions of ""cheating"" and only ordering one big 30 dollar all you can eat meat and sea food. we are not cheap and we are not crooks but according to your waitress and the comments she made about us being watched i guess we look like the type that would do such a thing. better choice of words would go a long way in a case like this.",1,0,0.9999035867789

meats - most were chewy and lacking flavour with the exception of the lamb. 

surf- a seafood mixed grill plate. salmon was mentioned but wasn't on the plate. grey meat, limp shelled, cold grab. ok shrimp. 

pineapple this is what we cave for. it was not the lovely caramelized version i'm used to but charred lukewarm fruit.

CGD0lollssfiwGeO85jzDA,2016,"we came here for a late lunch because we had an entertainment coupon (bogo) and with a party of two, the price is reasonable.  however, the experience was less than stellar and of 3 brazillian steakhouses we have been to, this is definitely in the bottom third.  

first, you are not a welcomed guest.  their focus is on upcharges and marketing.  first, they charge a tap water charge of $1.00 per person purportedly for special water processing.  seems that their special processing might be a filter, if anything, since the water tasted tinny as if from old pipes and had a slight odor which was not expected (this was better than a previous visit where when we asked for water, they responded ""carbonated or still"" and surprised us with a $5 charge for the bottled ""still"" water they supplied). the buffet was okay, but with less selection than we are used to with and the ""heated"" items appeared to have been sitting for hours (the bread becoming tough and chewy and the bananas cold).  one in our party ordered all you can drink mixed alcoholic drinks which was very disappointing.  the $10 charge was supposed to provide an hour of unlimited service.  however, once ordered, the first drink took 20 minutes to come and was amply filled with ice - two normal sips and it was gone, and each subsequent request took effort to obtain since the bar personnel took great strides to not be available,  at the end of the hour, the total was probably less than one drink anywhere else. 

as part of pampas' marketing, they circulate an employee with a camera who ostensibly provides a free photo.  the free photo is a postage stamp sized photo on a large advertisement for the restaurant.  they also showed a couple of large photos which they try to sell ($10 or more per print).  we declined. we asked what they do with all the unsold photos they collect, but the employee did not know.

as far as the meat service, servers were pretty conscientious at making the rounds in the sparsely occupied restaurant, but there was only two choices for beef, two choices for pork (one a sausage) and chicken drumettes (we did not order the seafood). the beef and pork were somewhat bland but the sausage was tasty.  the chicken was dry but tasty. pampas' lunch selections were much more limited than the other two similar restaurants we have visited.

they are not looking for repeat business, and i hope for the sake of others, they'll be out of business soon.  

they have deals to sucker people in, but they've trained their staff to add additional hidden costs without your prior knowledge.  it's a lot like getting a cheap airline ticket and you think it's a great deal; only to find out that their raping your pocket book for things that should be complimentary.

for example, they charged an $8 mandatory water assigned to every table that does not include free refills (of water?!) --just to start.

a meal ended up being $300 (for 2 adults) @ 3pm in less than an hour; so needless to say that coupon i bought basically did jack squat.

MsSLoEgSD9beYVczLTLjcg,2010,"let me get to the point right now... do not eat here!  this was a bomb from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  we made reservations.  when we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. we noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. it's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think ""wow, let's eat here, it's so busy"".   it's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  so now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  the inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  the waitress looked ""frazzled"" that we choise to eat inside.  so she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  many nice tables available.  then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say ""hi"" i'm your waiter/waitress.  we were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  so i order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  well to keep this short, the meat carving people do not make their rounds consistently.  they leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  i sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  then someone shows up.  you can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  one of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  it was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  this was a let down.  my wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  the dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that i cant believe they would serve that!  the pasta was overcooked.  they only served me 5  types of meat while there. the filet mignon was the only one i could comfortably chew.  the rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  we over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.

let me tell all of you that read this.  this place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  this place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. this place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  i should have payed attention to the other yelper comments out there, and i got burned.  oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  gross!  one last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her facebook photos.... ""class act"" here people.  you can see, this place is a bomb from start to finish.  take my advice.... and others.... just pass over this place, it should close it's doors... for good.",1,0,0.9876933531588411
k9xTd9KXoXS0KMjWeYDy_A,2014,"we had to ask twice to have meat brought to us (once when a hostess walked by, another time by walking up to the hostess station when we couldn't find a waitress). prior to asking, in our first 45 minutes there, we had been only been offered chorizo and ham. when we did finally start getting food, most of it was dry and/or unseasoned. the only cuts either of us actually liked were the chorizo and the bacon-wrapped chicken. when my wife wanted another drink, we once again had to seek out the hostess and ask to get one. and when it was time for dessert, we ordered flan, which isn't a dessert they make on the spot (unless it's a box mix, i guess). it should have just been a matter of picking up the dish from the fridge and bringing it out, but it took so long that we gave up  and went to the hostess to ask for our check for the one drink we had that wasn't covered by our groupon. maybe our experience was a result of having a groupon?

again, we waited as the hostess consulted with two servers, neither of which were our server. i had to walk over to them again and this time asked for the manager. we waited several minutes for the manager, as the hostess asked to to ""hold on"" while she seated other guests. i got so tired of the waiting that i actually just told the hostess, ""nevermind, we're leaving"" when she turned around and said ""there's the manager"".

the manager was apologetic (nobody else was), but despite our experience and my request that she just comp us the $7 or whatever for the drink, since we didn't even have the dessert that was supposed to be included, she still insisted that i needed to pay ""the tax"". it was only $2.49, so i paid and left. but i'm not sure what was taxed. sales tax is 8%, so to have $2.49 in sales tax would require a bill of over $30. and, again, we had a groupon that covered everything except for one sangria, so i'm not sure what i was being taxed on.

the kicker was the bill came and we were charged for water that was served-but never drank.  
 our bills were all on separate tickets. our bill was $1.08 ..... normally we are over the top tippers. either the waitstaff was extremely new or overwhelmed. but, the restaurant looked fairly busy-but not crazy busy. we paid our $1.08 bill for the un-drank bottled water?? who charges for  water? ... and left a ""dollar "" tip for the server, who ignored our requests for "" where is our meal"" for 90 minutes... it was a dollar more than he deserved...we are normally not ""complainers@... but, seriously? 90 minutes for a raw lobster tail??? then the nerve to charge us a buck for water? this restaurant gets minus 100 stars... and as a side note-my yelp reviews are 99% good...

didn't catch his name... we were there at 6pm on monday night...female asian manager came over...sorry ref not remembering name ref the. manager's name..
who was really apologetic-and offered a drink or dessert on the house...we all paid separately-the other guests-who ate the all you can eat meat-they had no complaints...the problem was they were done eating by the time our lobster arrived-and ""raw""...and our friends were ready to leave & our meal had not even arrived...which would have been ok.. but, we were the driver...

the greeter/waiter/bartender/cook did his best, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the horrible food and lack of service. when the bill arrived, of course he tried to charge us for the inedible chicken!!!! after getting the corrected bill, we couldn't pay and get out of there fast enough!!!! please don't waste your time on this place!!!!!!",1,0,0.9988271190609449

on the other hand, the service was awful.  i know that's a thing in tourist towns like vegas and new orleans in general.  but, even compared to other places in town, the service is bad.  not so much from the guys bringing the skewers of meat.  how can you not like those guys?  they show up with a smile and food?

but the main waiter seemed completely disinterested.  he tried to sell us a bottle of wine for $30 with his strong recommendation, and once we declined i don't think i saw him again for an hour.  we had to ask the manager to get our drinks refilled.  we eventually complained about having to wait for the bill.  we were offered free dessert--and then charged for it until we complained.  

and while the manager apologized for the poor service, never once did the waiter mention it or offer an explanation.  they were kind of busy, but not slammed by any means.  i swear, he just seemed irked that we didn't buy the bottle of wine.

there are other places in town offering the same basic deal (texas de brazil, for one) and the service was better and the overall class was a step up.

again, there was nothing wrong with the food--it was priced similar to the competition and very good.  it was just the attitude of the people working there.",3,0,0.9990611136819872

HWoYUJMYiQ7diRQbu-SIVw,2015,"just don't.

to me this is as simple of an explanation that i can give to my thoughts on pampas churrascaria.  to an extent, it pains me to say this because the meat was, as advertised, very good.  the rest of the experience, however, was not up to par with, to be honest, my lowest expectation.

the strategy of this business is very simple.  get people in the door, get them fed, get them out not caring about repeat business because we are all tourists anyways.  they are the classic coupon/gimmick facility mimicking the stores that mark their prices up merely so they can offer a discount and people feel like they are getting a deal.  you won't.  i guarantee that, even by vegas standards, you will pay more then what it is worth despite your 2-1 coupon that somebody handed you on the strip, or your groupon, or one of the other discounts that every single person in line seemed to have.  

i'll admit that it is tempting.  we fell for it.  after reading several varying accounts we decided to give it a chance but afterwards we were left with this feeling of good meats completely void of any type of atmosphere which is really quite sad.

now to be fair, pampas does receive some accolades from me and i'll explain them here.  

first, the hostess station was commendable.  despite being extremely busy they were able to accommodate us earlier then our reservation when we asked.  they also handled a very heavy workload filled with very needy people quite well.  people were jumping the line to ask questions, hovering around them, not an easy work environment for a restaurant employee and i felt they did an excellent job.  the question remains, however, why is the structure set up in this way to allow a line with roughly 20 people in it just to check in.

secondly, the cuts of meat were delicious and they seemed to come around often enough.  if you are in the food industry and you have good food that should account for a star.  we also had the tiramisu for dessert which was a great portion and very tasty.

outside of these two bright spots however, this place could not live up to even the mildest of expectations.  the buffet portion of the restaurant was incredibly lackluster and required a very treacherous journey dodging other patrons, trays and workers.  we ordered the surf and turf which was a complete waste and hardly touched given that fact.  the service was efficient but lacked any sort of outward personality whatsoever.  actually, that is not true, our server absolutely reeked of ""i'm too good for my job"" which inevitably led to much of the bad experience.  there were no facial expressions, no changing of tone of voice, it was as if it was a very apathetic robot was asking us if we wanted to start with water and then jabbing us with a $6 bottle which is another story.  i would rather deal with a server forgetting our food, screwing up our order, etc if their is a little bit of humanism behind it then deal with some arrogant facade.  maybe he was having a bad day, i know that happens but for some reason i really doubt that was the case.

all in all, if you are considering this place that means you are in vegas.  and if you are in vegas you have virtually an unlimited variety of establishments serving up amazing food.  it's not worth your time and it  is not worth your money, and when they are so many other worthy options all around you make sure you don't waster either of those things here.",2,0,0.9933174579267497

5imQ8qykY0rR2DgYRPL2QQ,2012,"i love to eat brazilian food and i try new places all over the country. i was in las vegas this past weekend and received a coupon from a girl in planet hollywood mall, so we decided to go try it. the coupon was for $5 off lunch. we went to the hostess and asked to see the menu first. we noticed that there was a lunch buffet on the menu. one part of the buffet was for salad bar only and the other one was for salad bar with churrascaria (meat). the churrascaria was $19.95 and the salad bar only was $13.95. we asked if the coupon reduced the price to $14.95 for meat or $8.95 for just salad bar only, and she said yes. my friend is a vegetarian that is why we asked about the salad bar only. we were in kind of a rush and needed to eat fast, so we said okay we would do the salad bar only. we received confirmation that it would be $8.95 per person. 
we fixed our plates and ate our salad bar, which was okay but nothing special. in fact the fried bananas were not like i usually eat at most brazilian places. i am used to fried plantains but these were some kind of stale fried bananas in corn meal, not even tempura batter, yuk! i actually spit it out. the black beans, rice and salad was actually good and i was enjoying it until we received the bill and they were charging us the normal price $13.95 per person. we calmly explained to the waitress that we gave the girl at the front our coupon. she came back and explained to us that the coupon was only for the churrascaria, not on the salad bar only. we explained to her that we had confirmed this with the hostess before being seated. we asked to speak to the manager to resolve the misunderstanding. 
the blonde hair male manager came over with a real smirk on his face and told us that there was nothing he could do. we explained again what we discussed with the hostess before being seated and he with a real big smirk on his face said she would never say that and called us liars! my mouth dropped! i was so in shock! i had never had that happen to me before. i kept my cool and tried to calmly explain but he just kept shaking his head no and smiling really hard, kind of weird like. my friend lost it and started screaming, ""are you calling us liars!"" the entire place stopped and started watching what was going on. he realized this and asked us what we expected him to do and we said nothing but honor what we were told when we arrived. he reluctantly changed the ticket and slammed it back on the table and walked off. the waitress was even embarrassed at his actions.
my friend and i paid the bill and swore we would never come back to this place as long as that manager was working there. i only wish that we could have gotten in touch with the owner because he should fire that guy.
as a business owner myself, i would never treat my customers like that or anyone for that is concerned. my only advice is that if you are offered a coupon to try it, make sure you get confirmation of the real deal and record it for proof just in case this guy does this again.

coming from the east coast, we have wide variety of brazilian cuisine, so is pretty hard to impress me! pampas by far the best option for brazilian bbq in las vegas. i have been to a few others, so i'm not just saying this based off of my liking of pampas. i've also tried other places many times due to the fact that pampas is on the strip, but assure you it's worth the drive! 


 service is always great, and the wait is never too long! i love that fact that the staff is friendly, and does their best to accommodate guests . last night we went in for a late dinnerwent with my daughters. a tired 6 y/o , and 10 month old, it was hard to get up and move around, but the staff was so thoughtful, and took it upon themselves to bring dishes from the buffet, to the table. being that they were out of some, and to continuously get up was a bit challenging.   

our server was very sweet, as well as informative. she made sure let us know about the variety of meats, as well as any coupons that applied to us.

the atmosphere was odd, as the music choices varied from sad and monotomic to hard rock, with little to enhance the authenticity of the establishment and its brazillian heritage. service was ok, but nothing spectacular. the servers of the various meats often gave poor pieces, rarely giving center cuts. they also came around sparingly at times, as only 2 were working from 3:30 to 4:45 that we could tell. our waiter, rigo, was nice so this review is on indicative of his job. rather, it is indicative of the chefs and management of the establishment.

we were seated relatively quickly. then the dining experience began. we waited for over 5 minutes for our server to come to the table only to say she was going to get us water then be back. okay, no problem. she comes back and we inform her we have the groupon. she immediately becomes rude and when i tried to order a drink she said ""wait a minute. the groupon is a process."" okay....sorry? she finally takes our drink orders then quickly explained the process of the dining experience to where we didn't completely understand what would happen. 

we went and got plates at the salad bar and their selection was sub par. a few dressings, barely any toppings for salad, and when i went to the cheese section they had empty holes in the ice where the cheese was supposed to be. the meats were okay, some were way too salty and ended up drying out. the ham and the pineapple were the only two items that were absolutely delicious. 

our server told us that halfway through our meal we would receive the surf part of the surf and turf. after being there almost 45 minutes, i asked about it and she said ""oh you didn't get it? ha i didn't even notice that. i'll put it in for you right now."" she then gave us choices for desert and we picked the chocolate explosion cake. our surf arrived and everything was completely cold, mixing the poke with mussels in the same bowl? the unfried fish was slimy and smelled horrible. our desert tasted completely like powdered sugar. 

for the all you can drink, we got 4 drinks. she was always ""waiting on the bar"" and barely came to check on us at all the entire time. the service was horrible. i am not one to get a manager but i was so beyond disappointed in this place.

0QfyzOcvjwRyJbVquHywJw,2019,"the food was very good. to my surprise, the best thing i had at this brazilian bbq spot was not actually meat, it was the grilled pineapple. the highlight of my experience was with john martinez, our server. i explained that my wife and i were short on time and needed to catch our flight leaving in 90 minutes. he understood and did everything to hasten our experience. he informed the other waiters to bring the meats to our table, refilled our water, and even brought the check so that we could pay in advance and leave right away. additionally, he gave us directions to the fastest way across the strip to caesers which saved us previous minutes. john is a great guy and went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience. we caught our flight with time to spare.",4,1,0.043032419954011414
D3FXvd42wchT9rMhhpVFbQ,2018,"we were there at 4p.m.  restaurant was half empty.  we waited over 15 minutes for waiter , he took our drink order and said nothing else.  we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks, we  told him this was our first time here he still walked away without saying anything.  we saw other guests walking to salad bar, so we did the same.  salad bar was nothing special, area was very crowded.  most of the meat was very dry and not seasoned.  chicken was very very salty.  servers were not very friendly,  
terribly overpriced, bad service ,   las  vegas has plenty of  fine restaurants  where they make you feel welcome and happy that you chose to eat  there.  pampas employees seem irritated that you had the audacity to eat there",1,0,0.9997796994192177
55fnfhZAsJ746Wipyu911Q,2017,"pampas has great food and you won't be disappointed with the quality here, but the price is quite pricy. there was someone right outside the door of the resturant offering a 2 for 1 promo, as long as everyone got drinks, so the price wasn't bad for us, but without promo's the price can get out of hand quite quickly. the quality of food was equally as good as texas de brazil, so i'm a fan in that sense, but definitely search for coupons, or see if you can get a promo from the guy right outside, don't just go in without trying for a deal first.",4,1,0.0811584830244152

E6wz_wK6UW-Hjxz1QZAgiA,2015,"my girlfriend and i paid for a show and dinner. we expected to have a limited menu, but not that limited. three slices of meat an 1/8th inch thick that tasted like a unclean grill. the garlic potatoes were absolutely disgusting. the waitress was rude and short with no personality. 
when our meal came the waitress waited a good ten minutes before asking how our horribly prepared food was. my girlfriend replied, it would be better if i had something else, the waitress replied ok then turns and went to another table.
i sought after the manager, i asked her what she would do if it was her. she replied i would just walk away. after that i had my food voucher returned and we will never darken the doorstep to inconvenience them to my little money that was called ""free"" by the manager even though i bought it in a show bundled. ""free"" is not paying a premium for a show and dinner with crap service. 

the  was for how beautiful the place was.",1,0,0.9999723341554939
